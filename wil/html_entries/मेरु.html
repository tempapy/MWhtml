<div id="definition"><ul><li><sk slp1="meru">meru</sk> m. (<sk slp1="-ruH">-ruḥ</sk>) The sacred mountain <i>Meru,</i> in the centre of the seven continents, compared to the cup or seed-vessel of the lotus, the leaves of which are formed by the different <i>Dvīpas:</i> its height is said by the <i>Hindus</i> to be 84,000 <i>Yojanas,</i> sixteen thousand of which are below the surface of the earth: the shape is variously described, as square, conical, columnar, spherical, or spiral; and the four faces of it are of various colours, or white towards the east, yellow to the south, back to the west, and red towards the north: the river <i>Ganges</i> falls from heaven on its summit, and flows thence to the surrounding worlds in four streams; the southern branch is the <i>Ganges</i> of <i>India,</i> the northern running into <i>Tartary</i> is the <i>Bhadrasomā,</i> the eastern is the <i>Sītā,</i> and the western the <i>Cakṣu</i> or <i>Oxus:</i> on the summit of <i>Meru</i> BRAHMĀ resides, attended and worshipped by the <i>Ṛṣis, Gandharbas,</i> &amp;c. the regents of the points of the compass occupy the corresponding faces of the mountain, the whole of which consists of gold and gems: considered in any but a fabulous light, mount <i>Meru</i> appears to mean the high land of <i>Tārtary,</i> immediately to the north of the <i>Himālaya</i> mountains. <br/>E. <sk slp1="mi">mi</sk> to scatter, (radiance,) Uṇādi aff. <sk slp1="ru">ru</sk>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=wil&amp;page=674">[674]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="मेरक.html">◀ meraka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="मेरुक.html">meruka ▶</a></div></div>
