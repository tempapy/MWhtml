(<sk slp1="-juH">-juḥ</sk>) The <i>Yajur</i> or <i>Yajuṣ,</i> one of the four <i>Vedas;</i> it is divided into two principal portions, the white and black, or <i>Vājasaneyi</i> and <i>Taittirīya,</i> the former of which is attributed to the saint YĀJÑAVALKYA, to whom it was revealed by the sun, in the form of a horse; and the latter to TITTIRI, to whom it was communicated by YĀSKA, the first pupil of its original author, the sage VAIŚAMPĀYANA: according to the <i>Purāṇas,</i> the <i>Taittirīya</i> portion was named from <i>Tittiri</i> a partridge; the disciples of VAIŚAMPĀYANA being changed into those birds, to pick up the texts of the <i>Veda,</i> as they were disgorged in a tangible shape by YĀJÑAVALKYA, at the command of VAIŚAMPĀYANA: both portions of this <i>Veda</i> are very full on the subject of religious rites, and the prayers peculiar to it, are chiefly in measured and poetical prose. <b>E.</b> <sk slp1="yaja">yaja</sk> to worship, Uṇādi aff. <sk slp1="usi">usi</sk>.  </li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="यजुर्वेद.html">◀ yajurveda</a></div><div id="next"><a href="यज्ञ.html">yajña ▶</a></div></div>
