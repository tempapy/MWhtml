<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>aparāntaka</b>, f. <b>°ikā</b>, adj. <i>of the western border, or of</i> <i>the country called Aparānta</i>; used of cloth or garments, also as nt. noun, (cloth or garments) <i>of Aparānta</i> Mvy 9179; °ka- in cpd. Divy 316.26, of garments (adj. or noun?). In Divy 20.22-23 perhaps read aparāntikayā guptikayā <i>in the style of Aparānta</i> (? see <b>guptikā</b>); text asmāt parānti°. In Divy 1.3; 18.6; 19.16, 19, 23; 21.2, 12 the mss. read corruptly, and with much variation, a text discussed by the editors on p. 703; they read asmāt parāntaka- and interpret as a synonym of <b>pratyantima</b>, except in 19.19 where they read asmākam aparāntaka-, interpreting (with privative a-) as the opposite, <i>not distant, near</i>. The forms are troublesome; without much confidence I suggest that forms of aparāntaka may have been found in all, meaning something like <i>of the western border</i> (if not speci- fically <i>of the country Aparānta</i>). But Tib. (Bailey, JRAS 1950.172) on 19.19 points to <b>Aśmāparāntaka</b>, q.v.; and this seems to have been the regular Tib. form acc. to Schiefner, cited Divy p. 703. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=044">[044,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अपरान्त.html">◀ aparānta</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अपरान्तकोटि.html">aparāntakoṭi ▶</a></div></div>
