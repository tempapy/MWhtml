<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>kṣatra</b> (nt.) = kṣetra, <i>field</i>. Cf. Pali DN 3.93.13 khettānaṃ patī ti…khattiyo (in an etymology), which shows that a popular association of kṣatriya with kṣetra (or of their MIndic equivalents) existed. Doubtless as a result of this, the secondary etymological blend-form kṣatra occurs often in LV, as in 208.13; 283.8; 352.18; 354.14, 22; 355.16; 357.4; 366.8; in all these all mss. and Lefm. kṣa°; in LV 290.8, 15; 353.1 Lefm. kṣe° but most mss. kṣa°. The mss. of Mv also--sometimes nearly all of them--read kṣa°, as in v.l. for kṣe° at i.121.9, 11, 12; 122.1, 2. In all these cases there is no doubt of the mg. <i>field</i>; it seems to me that Lefm. was right in recognizing the existence in BHS of kṣatra in this sense, because of its frequent occurrence, which the etym. in DN supports. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=198">[198,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="क्षत्तं.html">◀ kṣattaṃ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="क्षत्रियाणी.html">kṣatriyāṇī ▶</a></div></div>
