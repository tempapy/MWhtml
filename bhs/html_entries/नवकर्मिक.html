<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>navakarmika</b> (= Pali °kammika, said to mean <i>repairer of buildings</i>, but see below): Mvy 8735 °kaḥ = Tib. lag gi bla, which Das defines as <i>one who does general</i> <i>menial service to the congregation of lamas in a monastery</i>; MSV i.235.6, 9; ii.145.13; he was as a rule himself a monk, but inferior in position and function, as shown by Jm 113.22 (vs) āvāsikaḥ so 'stu mahāvihāre kacaṅgalāyāṃ navakarmikaś ca (as a punishment). That the navakam- mika in Pali, too, was low in station among monks is shown by the story of Sudhamma, Vin. ii.15.30 ff. (āvāsiko …navakammiko dhuvabhattiko), and navakamme in Jāt. iv.378.29 seems to mean <i>manual labor</i> (certainly not <i>repairing</i>, since a new structure was being built). I have found no Pali comm.'s interpretation, but the Pali word seems to need reexamination. Perhaps lit. <i>(one who per-</i> <i>forms) new-initiate's work</i> (see <b>nava</b>). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=291">[291,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="नव.html">◀ nava</a></div><div id="next"><a href="नवकान्त.html">navakānta ▶</a></div></div>
