<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>kovidāra</b>, m. (in Skt. n. of a tree, and also, in Hariv., of a heavenly tree, equated by BR with pārijāta; same two mgs. belong to Pali koviḷāra), in Mv i.32.4 and ii.452.1, at least, n. of one of the groves of the Trāyastriṃśa gods; elsewhere it is regularly equated or associated with pāri- jāta(ka), which seems as a rule to have its Skt. mg., or <b>pāriyātra(ka)</b>, q.v.; cf. DPPN ‘The pāricchattaka (= pārijātaka, °yātraka; called a tree, but 100 leagues in circumference) is generally described as a koviḷāra’; it is certainly sometimes a (heavenly) tree, e.g. Gv 193.9 pārijātaka-kovidāra-sadṛśān (vṛkṣān), but at other times it is hard to be sure whether it is conceived as a tree or a grove; e.g. Mvy 4199 (after pāriyātraḥ 4198, which is preceded by names of groves, but with 4200 ff. come words for individual trees); Divy 219.20 pāriyātrako (mss.) nāma kovidāro, 27 pārijātako kovidāro; SP 360.13--14 pārijā- takasya kovidārasya, and same Av ii.89.6 (°jātasya); Gv 501.11 (here pāriyātrakasya). Perhaps the explanation is that, like the Pali pāricchattaka, it was a single tree of such size as to be equivalent to a grove. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=195">[195,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कोलीसोवा.html">◀ kolīsovā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कोशगतवस्तिगुह्य.html">kośagatavastiguhya ▶</a></div></div>
