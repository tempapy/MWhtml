(daughter of <b>Daṇḍapāṇi</b>); 157.4 ff.; 194.7 ff.; 230.3 ff.; 237.19; Suv 200.8; in Mvy 1071 Gopī or Gopā, named next to Yaśodharā, but there is no reason to assume their identification (Mironov reads Gopā without v.l.); in Gv 385.6 ff. Gopā occurs as a Śākya-kanyā, who in 420.19 is the daughter of <b>Daṇḍapāṇi</b> (like the Gopā of LV), but there is here no suggestion that she married the Bodhisat- tva, tho she mentions him 419.20 (as well as <b>Vairocana</b>, 396.23). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=216">[216,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="गोपगिरि.html">◀ gopagiri</a></div><div id="next"><a href="गोपानसी.html">gopānasī ▶</a></div></div>
