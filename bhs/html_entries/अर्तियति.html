<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>ar(t)tiyati</b> or <b>°tīyati, °te</b>; in one doubtful passage perhaps ārtī°, otherwise always art° when not fused in saṃdhi with preceding vowel; forms occurring include ar(t)tīyati, °yanti, °tīyate, °tiyante, °tīyanto and °taṃ (pres. pple.), aritīyeran (! read art°), artita (ppp.); also ārtīyate (? v.l. attī°); attīyantā (and probably attīyate for prec.); ṛtīyate, °yante, °yamāna (pres. pple.; for ṛt° we usually find rit° written); ardīyamāna (pres. pple.); āstīryati; and noun <b>attīyanā</b>. The corresp. Pali (see CPD) is written aṭṭīyati, aṭṭhī°, aḍḍhī°, addiyati. Despite all this confusion, there is no doubt that we are dealing with essentially one word, with modifications due to diverse influences, including popular etymology and hyper-Sktism. Wogihara, ZDMG 58.454, gives the ‘correct form’ as ṛtīyate (which, or rather usually rit°, is customary in Bbh, but I believe occurs nowhere else), and the mg. as <i>er</i> <i>schämt sich</i>; both statements are wrong, I believe. As to mg., Wogihara was evidently influenced by the fact that the word is often associated in Pali with harāyati, jiguc- chati, and in BHS with jehrīyate, (vi)jugupsati, or equiv- alents. But it is also often used where <i>shame</i> cannot be involved. Most likely the MIndic word is a denominative from ārti (for which arti, with semi-MIndic shortening, is recorded even in Skt.). All forms are included here since the word is clearly a unit, but they are also entered under the several heading: (<b>1</b>) <i>is grieved, perturbed, distressed</i>: Mv i.219.17 = ii.21.19 kecit saṃsārapāśena arttiyante (ii.21.19 saṃsāracāreṇa artīyanti) yathā aham (said by the infant Bodhisattva), <i>are distressed</i>; Mv ii.161.7 bo- dhisattvo jātīye arttīyanto, <i>being pained by</i> (or, <i>on ac-</i> <i>count of</i>) <i>birth</i>, 11--12…maraṇena artt°, 13 śokehi artt°; Mv ii.242.13 arttīyati (Senart em. attī°); Mv i.89.18 (ākīrṇavihāreṇa) nārtīyanti; Mv ii.480.7 śokārtita; LV [Page066-b+ 71] 174.14 jarārtita; Bbh 166.11 ṛtīyamānaḥ (of a Bodhisattva); Bbh 171.9 ritīyamānaṃ. (<b>2</b>) In some transitional cases, leading over to the next group, the additional note of <i>aversion, revulsion</i> seems more or less clearly present: Bbh 282.7--8 tena pūrvakeṇādhimokṣeṇāritīyeran (read °ṇārtīyeran; but in same phrase line 23 °mokṣeṇa ritīyante), <i>they would be annoyed by, sick of, disgusted with their for-</i> <i>mer enthusiasm</i>; Bbh 168.23 ritīyate; Mvy 1830 nārtīyate (no context); (<b>3</b>) like preceding but accompanied by parallel forms of hrī-, jugups-, or the like: SP 108.6 daridracintayārtīyantaṃ jehrīyamāṇaṃ jugupsamānaṃ, <i>distressed, ashamed, disgusted by the thought of being poor</i>; Mv i.343.1 (tena adharmeṇa) attīyantā (Senart em. artī°) vijigupsantā or °satā (mss. °satāṃ, evidently pres. pple., Senart em. wrongly °sitā) <i>distressed and disgusted by this</i> <i>immorality</i>; Karmav 47.26 āstīryati jihreti vigarhati vijugupsati, <i>is distressed, ashamed, offended, disgusted</i> (by acts he has done); 49.2; Divy 39.7 ye 'nena pūtikāyen- ārdīyamānā jehrīyante vijugupsamānāḥ, <i>being distressed,</i> <i>are ashamed, disgusted</i>; (<b>4</b>) with abl., <i>feels aversion</i> (from): MadhK 297.2, text ārtīyate (ebhyo dharmebhyo), but v.l. attīyate, so prob. read; followed by jehrīyate vitarati vijugupsate; in line 4 below (see note 1) mss. dharmebhyo attīyanā (text artī°) vijugupsanā (nouns). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=066">[066,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अर्तित.html">◀ artita</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अर्तीयना.html">artīyanā ▶</a></div></div>
