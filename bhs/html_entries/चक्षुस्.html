<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>cakṣus</b>, in pañca-c° (= Pali pañca-cakkhu), <i>the five</i> <i>superior qualities of vision</i> (partly physical, partly mental or spiritual) possessed by a Buddha (cf. pañcacakṣuḥ- samanvāgata LV 3.5; 403.2, of Buddha): listed, in agree- ment except for order, Dharmas 66; Sūtrāl. xviii.54, comm.; and Mv i.158.1 ff., where each is explained in some detail, viz. māṃsa-c° 158.8--159.5; divya-c° 159.5--7; prajñā-c° 159.8--9; dharma-c° 159.9--160.7 (= daśānāṃ balānāṃ manovibhutā, 159.10; then follows a statement on the 10 bala, 159.12--160.5, in verse); and buddha-c° 160.7--16 (this = the 18 āveṇikā buddhadharmāḥ, which are then listed). In Pali (see Childers and PTSD) the list contains maṃsa-, dibba-, paññā-, and buddha-cakkhu, but for dharma- substitutes samanta-c° (before or after buddha-c°). A difficult and corrupt line, Mv i.42.15 = 53.12 = 337.4 (in the last printed by Senart as prose), contains some form of bhava-cakṣuka, which Senart regards as containing a *bhava-cakṣu(s) = māṃsa-c°, quite wrongly; his transl. (note on 42.15) misunderstands māṃsa-c° which is a complimentary and superior power, not one to be derogated. Possibly rather <i>eye of existence</i> and agreeing with prajñā-skandha (337.4 prajñā-cakṣu[r])? The preponderant evidence of the mss. points to bhava- cakṣuke (or °ko or °kaiḥ) apāye prajñāskandho (or °dhe, °dhā; 337.4 see above) niveśeyaṃ (? °yaḥ, or other vv.ll.). All too obscure to be useful. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=221">[221,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="चक्षुष्मती.html">◀ cakṣuṣmatī</a></div><div id="next"><a href="चग्घति.html">cagghati ▶</a></div></div>
