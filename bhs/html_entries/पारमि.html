<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>pārami-, °mī</b> (f.; = Pali id., in Pali used both as in BHS, pāramippatta, °miṃ-gata, Childers, and, usually in the form pāramī, as equivalent of BHS <b>pāramitā</b> 2; BHS seems to use it only once in this latter sense; seems [Page341-b+ 71] clearly deriv. in secondary -a, fem. -ī, from parama), <i>mastery, supremacy</i>; usually in vss; in LV 414.19 (vs) read ṣaḍi pārami te, <i>the six supremacies</i> (= <b>pāramitā</b> 2) <i>are thine</i> (see § 19.24); otherwise noted by me only in forms °mi-, °mī-, and (with -gata) most commonly °miṃ-, in comp. with following -gata or -prāpta (edd. often print the cpd. as two words), <i>arrived at, attained to mastery</i>, often in comp. with preceding word stating the field of mastery, but also used absolutely, aham atra °mī-prāpto SP 35.6 (vs; so ed. with Kashgar rec.; Nep. mss. pāramitā-, cpd. with foll. nirdiṣṭaḥ); or with gen. or loc. preceding; pāramiṃgata SP 451.5 (vs, ṛddhībala-); 453.2 (vs, svara- maṇḍala-), 5 (vs, sarvaguṇa-); LV 28.6 (vs, iṣvastraśiṣyeṣu ca); 398.19 (vs, āryadharmeṣv iha); Divy 637.5 (vs, printed as prose; mantrāṇāṃ); Mv i.47.4 (vs, vaśi-, q.v.); 74.4 (vs, ṛddhipādabala-); 129.6 (vs, śastre hi, so divide), <i>for I have attained supremacy in weapons</i> (even beyond you, see <b>ati-r-iva</b>); 164.11 (vs, cittasthititve asi); 166.9 (vs, śreṣṭheṣu dharmeṣu; 3 mss. unmetr. °mi-gato; the other three °miṃ-gato; Senart em. °mī-gato, why ?); 169.18 (vs, puṇyeṣu); Gv 488.22 (vs, sarvabuddhaguṇa-); the preceding nouns are only rarely those included in the lists of <b>pāramitā</b> (2), but such occur with °miṃgata Mv ii.368.2 (vs, kṣāntiye); RP 5.16 (vs, prajñ' upāya sada); °mi-gata RP 13.11 (vs, dhyāne vīryaguṇe ca); in the last, and in the foll. cases, it seems likely that the short i is m.c.: mi-gata LV 110.7 (vs, vararūpa-, read as cpd.); Mv i.215.4 and ii.18.1 (vs, rūpa-, in 18.1 read anurūpa-); ii.33.16 (vs, devaguṇa-); iii.355.12 (vs, cittacarita-); but before prāpta I have found °mī-prāpta only in the doubtful passage SP 35.6, above; no certain case of °miṃ-prāpta (cf. Mv i.226.9 below); and otherwise only °mi-prāpta, once in prose, Mv i.237.12 (uttamadamaśamatha-); and in vss (note that the syllable °mi- may be metrically either long, as in Pali °mippatta, or short!), LV 437.12 (vineya-); Śikṣ 324.20; Mv i.115.7 (vaiśāradyavara-); 152.11 = 226.5 = ii.29.8 (lakṣaṇa- or °ṇa-guṇa-; mss. always °mi-, but the syllable is long in the last two cases, short in the first); i.152.15 = 226.9 (here mss. °miṃ-prāp°! but °mi in the others; syllable is long) = ii.29.12 (lakṣaṇaguṇa-). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=341">[341,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="पारजन्मिक.html">◀ pārajanmika</a></div><div id="next"><a href="पारमिता.html">pāramitā ▶</a></div></div>
