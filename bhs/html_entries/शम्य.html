<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>śamya</b>, or (in LV always written) <b>sa°</b> (= Pali samma, here m.; for Skt. see below), a kind of cymbal, always in LV and often in Pali in cpd. with <b>tāḍa</b> (tāḷa), which usually follows but in LV 301.16 precedes this (PTSD wrongly makes sammatāḷa the n. of a single instrument; Pali comms., e.g. Jāt. vi.61.7--8, make it a dvandva, and samma occurs alone in Pali); Skt. has only śamyā- (-tāla, e.g. Mbh. Cr. ed. 2.4.31), which is known in BHS only in Mvy 5018; in Skt. often and in LV always, acc. to Lefm., written with p for y, but (cf. pw 6.208) Pali proves that y is right, p a graphic corruption; prob. identical with Skt. śamyā, <i>wedge</i>, from the shape of the instrument; the m. (or ṇt.) stem in -a is not recorded in Skt. but is the only one recorded in Pali as n. of a mus. instrument, and so (except for Mvy) in BHS; in LV only stem-form recorded in long dvandva cpds. of names of mus. instruments: LV 40.20; 163.6 (here Calc. samya); 206.14; 212.4 (here °tāḍāvacara-); -tāḍa-sampādīṃś ca (no v.l.) 301.16. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=523">[523,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शम्बर.html">◀ śambara</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शम्याप्रास.html">śamyāprāsa ▶</a></div></div>
