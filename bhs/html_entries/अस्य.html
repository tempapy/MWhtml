<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>asya</b>, also <b>sya</b>, apparently particle of emphasis; acc. to Senart on Mv i.45.1, = Skt. svid, Pali su (also assu). (Note that PTSD s.v. su^3 derives this not only from Skt. svid but also from Skt. sma, for which it there states that Pali also has sa and assa; but neither of these forms is cited in their proper places in PTSD; Andersen, Reader, Glossary s.v. sudaṃ, also mentions sa and assa as occur- ring for Skt. sma but does not list them; PTSD s.v. assu cites once assa as v.l. for assu; otherwise I have no record of Pali (as)sa as a particle.) In mss. of Mv anya or anyaṃ is sometimes read for asya: evam asya syāt Mv i.45.1, 5, 9, 12; kim asya nāma i.343.4; tasya sya dharmā i.292.1; kiṃ sya nāma, and kena sya nāma, i.346.8 and 9, 15 and 16; 347.3. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=085">[085,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अस्मिसंज्ञा.html">◀ asmisaṃjñā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अह.html">aha ▶</a></div></div>
