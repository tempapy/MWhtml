<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>anyatra</b>, adv., (<b>1</b>) <i>on the contrary</i> (this mg. seems exclusively peculiar to BHS); always after negative ex- pressions: SP 73.10 anyatra tena tenaiva dhāvanti, (they pay no attention and do not understand;) <i>on the contrary,</i> <i>they run this way and that</i>; 102.9 na kasyacid ācakṣed anyatraika evātmanādhyātmaṃ saṃtapyed, <i>he would not</i> <i>speak of it to anyone; on the contrary, he would all alone</i> <i>be grieving himself by himself</i>; 284.9; 378.4; LV 71.6 (Māyā felt no heaviness of body, gurukāyatāṃ;) anyatra laghutām eva, <i>on the contrary, nothing but lightness</i>; 259.16; 260.8; 268.15; Mv iii.66.8 and 15 (there is no soul nor anything resembling a soul;) atha evaṃ anyatra karma caiva karmavipākaṃ ca hetuś (first time, hetuṃ) caiva hetusamutpannā ca dharmā(ḥ), <i>but rather, on the contrary,</i> <i>only action</i> etc. (see under <b>atha</b>); Laṅk 9.7 (see s.v. <b>vikalpa</b>; wrongly Suzuki); 39.7 anyatra kāraṇataḥ, <i>on the contrary,</i> <i>from a cause</i> (wrongly Suzuki); 119.6 (place daṇḍa be- tween evam and anyatra); 152.1; RP 42.4; Samādh 22.39 [Page041-b+ 71] (wrongly Régamey); Śikṣ 147.3 (and several times in Śikṣ followed by <b>yāvad eva</b>, <i>just simply</i>, q.v.); the negative may be repeated just before anyatra, but only as resuming the neg. of the preceding clause, not negating the clause containing anyatra: Bbh 121. (19-)21 (a Bodhisattva does not give a petitioner the trouble of asking repeatedly before he gives him a gift;) nānyatra yācitamātra eva, <i>no; on the contrary</i>, (he gives) <i>the very moment he is asked</i>; (<b>2</b>) <i>except</i>; in Skt. and Pali hardly used except as pre- position (with abl. in Skt., Pali aññatra also with instr. and gen.); in Skt. very rarely as adverb, the noun being construed with other words in the sentence (see BR 1.266 and pw 3.251). In BHS I have noted a single case, not wholly certain, of anyatra as preposition with instr. (as in Pali, instead of abl. as in Skt.): RP 40.4 rātriṃdivaṃ bhavantībhir nānyā kathā kāryā, anyatra nṛttagītavād- itena, <i>you are to say nothing else, except dance, song, and</i> <i>instrumental music</i> (?). But the adverbial use in this mg., so rare in Skt. and not recorded for Pali, is well established in BHS; in the following cases the form and construction of other words in the clause is totally unaffected by anyatra; often it may be translated as if it were a con- junction, <i>except that…</i> It almost always follows a negative expression (or interrogative, rhetorically equivalent to neg.); and this is sometimes resumed by an additional na before anyatra (as in the last case under 1, above): Divy 6.28 sārthaṃ na paśyati nānyatra gardabhayānam eva, <i>he didn't see the caravan, not except only a donkey-</i> <i>cart</i>; and with anyatra as quasi-conjunction, Mv ii.90.14-15 nāsti anyo upāyo nānyatra etaṃ samudraṃ utsicāmi, <i>there is no other means, not</i> (any) <i>except</i> (that) <i>I bale out</i> (exhaust) <i>this sea</i>. In the next the na before anyatra goes with the main verb (or rather ppp.): SP 318.4 nānyatra sattvānāṃ paripācanārtham avatāraṇārtham ete dharma- paryāyā bhāṣitāḥ, <i>these dharmaparyāya are not spoken</i> <i>except</i> (i.e. are spoken only) <i>to mature creatures and make</i> <i>them arrive at comprehension</i>. Otherwise, after negs.: LV 149.1 (nānyaḥ…saṃvidyate ya etāṃ gaṇanāṃ prajānāty) anyatrāhaṃ vā yo vā syān mādṛśaḥ, <i>except</i> (it be) <i>I or</i> <i>someone like me</i>; SP 276.6-7 na ca taiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃ- stavaṃ karoty anyatropasaṃkrāntānāṃ…dharmaṃ bhāṣate, <i>and he has no association with them, except that…</i> <i>he preaches the Law to them when they come to him</i>; similarly 276.9--10; 324.8 yūyaṃ ca śabdaṃ na śṛṇotha mahyaṃ, anyatra so nirvṛtu lokanāthaḥ, <i>and you do</i> (would) <i>not</i> <i>listen to my words, except</i> (i.e. <i>unless</i>; sc. you believed that) <i>the Lord of the World has entered nirvāṇa</i>; Sukh 42.(10--)11 (na ca…nānātvam asty) anyatra…saṃ- khyāṃ gacchanti, <i>except that…</i>; Laṅk 19.8 (a passage badly misunderstood by Suzuki; e.g. in 7 read 'dharmā = adharmāḥ) na lakṣaṇataḥ kalpyāḥ (delete daṇḍa) te 'nyatra saṃvyavahārārthā abhidhīyante, <i>they</i> (impos- sibilities like the son of a barren woman) <i>are not conceiv-</i> <i>able by way of characteristic marks, except that</i> (? or possibly <i>on the contrary</i>, to 1) <i>they are spoken of as terms of common</i> <i>use</i> (they have existence only as words); Laṅk 20.1 anyatra …vibhāvyate, <i>except that it is discussed…</i> (after neg.); after interrog., Av ii.121.4 kānyā putrasya gatir anyatra mātāpitarāv eva, <i>what other recourse could there be for a</i> <i>son</i> (i.e. there could be none), <i>except his parents</i>; no negative (except by vague implication), Divy 293. (15-)16 (annādyaṃ parikṣīṇam) anyatra…ekā mānikā…ava- śiṣṭā, (edible things were destroyed, i.e. there were none), <i>except that…one m. was left</i>; Gv 206.5 (see s.v. <b>upād-</b> <b>āya</b> 1 d). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=041">[041,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अन्यतीर्थिक.html">◀ anyatīrthika</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अन्यथात्व.html">anyathātva ▶</a></div></div>
