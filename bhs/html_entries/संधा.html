<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>saṃdhā</b> (cf. the Skt. mg. <i>Absicht</i>, pw s.v. 3, and <b>saṃdhāya</b>), <i>(special, cryptic,) esoteric meaning</i>, the ‘real’ meaning of a Buddhist text or doctrine, opp. to its prima facie or superficial meaning; perh. always in comp. with a word for <i>speech, words</i>, or the like; but see also <b>saṃ-</b> <b>dhi</b> (5); see <b>ābhiprāyika</b>, which S.K. De, NIA 1.5, is right in relating to this; my note in JAOS 57.185 ff. is prob. misleading in regarding <i>complete meaning</i> as basic; Tib. regularly dgoṅs (te), <i>meaning, intention</i>, often pre- ceded, sometimes replaced, by ldem po(r), <i>in a riddlesome</i> <i>way</i>; nevertheless the implication of the word is always <i>fundamental, ‘real’ meaning</i>, as is esp. shown by SP 60.12--13 (prose) yat punar bhagavann asmābhir anupasthiteṣu bo- dhisattveṣu saṃdhābhāṣyaṃ bhagavato 'jānamānais tva- ramāṇaiḥ prathamabhāṣitaiva tathāgatasya dharmadeśanā śrutvodgṛhītā, <i>but in as much, Lord, as we, not knowing</i> <i>the Lord's words as He really intended them</i> (<i>esoterically,</i> <i>cryptically</i>, Tib. ldem por dgoṅs te bśad pa), <i>there being</i> <i>no bodhisattvas on hand, in our haste heard and accepted</i> <i>merely His prima-facie words</i>; so, saṃdhā-bhāṣya (Tib. usually as above) SP 29.7; 34.2, 10; 39.11; 70.5 (vs, Tib. ldem ṅag, omitting dgoṅs) and 8 (vs, Tib. as in 60.12--13 but om. ldem por); 273.14 and 337.2 (vss); saṃdhā-bhāṣita (Tib. generally as in 60.12--13) 125.2, 3 (see below; ldem por om. in 3); 199.2 (gsuṅs for bśad); 233.11 (parama- saṃdhā-bhāṣita-vivaraṇo hy ayaṃ dharmaparyāyas); 288.2; saṃdhā-vacanehi, °naṃ, SP 59.4 and 5 (here Tib. om. dgoṅs; in 4 ldem poḥi ṅag [= bśad or gsuṅs] rnams, <i>riddle-words</i>; in 5 ldem po ṅag); note Buddha's words in [Page557-a+ 71] SP 125.1 na sahasaiva sarvajñajñānaṃ saṃprakāśayāmi, <i>I do not reveal the Omniscient's knowledge all at once</i>, given as reason for his hearers' failure to understand saṃdhā- bhāṣitaṃ, since (3) …durvijñeyaṃ…tathāgatānāṃ …saṃdhābhāṣitam. Note that this form seems to occur only in SP, while the ger. saṃdhāya is more widespread; saṃdhi, however, seems to be used, tho rarely, in the same sense, and once in Laṅk text has <b>saṃdhyā-bhāṣya</b>, q.v., clearly in this same mg., and prob. error for saṃdhā°. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=556">[556,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="संद्वेष.html">◀ saṃdveṣa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="संधान.html">saṃdhāna ▶</a></div></div>
