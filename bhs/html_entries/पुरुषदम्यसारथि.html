<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>puruṣa-damya-sārathi</b> (= Pali purisa-damma-sā°; expl. Vism. 207.22 ff. essentially as here interpreted), <i>charioteer (driver, tamer, controller) of human ones-that-need-</i> <i>to-be-tamed</i> (= <i>trained</i> religiously; as Vism. indicates, dam = vi-nī, <i>discipline</i>); the figure clearly refers to taming animals, particularly horses, and indeed is no doubt directly based on Pali assa-damma-sārathi, q.v. in CPD; cf. such expressions as puruṣājāneya (see s.v. <b>ājāneya</b>), <i>noble steed of a man</i>. Ep. of a Buddha, or a Bodhisattva just before his attainment of Buddhahood. Often misunder- stood; further evidence supporting the interpretation here given will be found below. Tib. (on Mvy 10, LV 3.4 etc.) skyes bu ḥdul baḥi (<i>of human [to-be-] tamed ones</i>, more lit. <i>of [to-be-] tamed men</i>) kha lo (b)sgyur ba (<i>helm-governor =</i> <i>charioteer</i>). In Tocharian yātäṣlyes yāpy ā(śa)nt, <i>leader of</i> <i>one to be tamed</i> (omitting puruṣa; yāpy is uncertain, possibly <i>helm</i> as in Tib.). Regularly in cliché listing characteristics of a Buddha: SP 17.11; 65.6; 144.6; 156.4; LV 3.4; Mvy 10; Mv i.38.12; 238.15; 330.2; 331.1; 332.4; 335.16; Divy 54.13 etc.; Av i.65.12 etc.; Suv 168.10; in Mv i.4.9 (read with mss., and print the sentence as an āryā vs, not prose as in Senart) puruṣasiṃhasārathinā (Senart em. puruṣadamya°), <i>controller of lions of men</i>, evidently meant as a much stronger variant of the usual term, but incidentally confirms our interpretation of the latter; so also does the epithet puruṣadamyasārathinā in another formulaic series of epithets applied to the Bo- dhisattva just before his enlightenment, in which several preceding epithets compare him to animals, such as puruṣarṣabheṇa, puruṣasiṃhena: LV 350.12; Mv i.229.9; ii.133.9; 284.19; 415.21; in less formulaic passages LV 428.5; abstr. °sārathi-tā, <i>state of being…</i>, meaning the state of Buddhahood which Bodhisattvas are to attain: Mv ii.260.11; 261.12. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=348">[348,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="पुरुषकारक.html">◀ puruṣakāraka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="पुरे.html">pure ▶</a></div></div>
