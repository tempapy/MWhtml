<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>ābṛhati</b> (and āvṛhati; see also <b>āvṛṃhati</b>) both occur in Skt. in mg. <i>extracts, draws out</i>, and in Pali as abbahati, abbuhati, abbū°, abbāheti, id. (as, thorns); both are so used also in BHS; but in BHS they both (oftener, it seems, spelled with v) have also the meaning exclusively noted for <b>āvarhati</b>, <i>restores</i> (a monk to good standing), which in Pali is abbheti (noun, abbhāna), apparently from Skt. āhvayati. I shall record such mgs., even where texts read āb°, under <b>āvarhati</b>; in BHS the two groups are not clearly distinguishable. They may even be identical in origin, as N. Dutt holds, MSV iii.74 n. 3 (<i>withdrawal of offences</i> committed by the monk implies restoration to good stand- ing); so also in essence, tho doubtfully, Finot, Prāt 488 n. 1. But on this theory it is hard to explain Pali abbheti (abbhāna), and I incline to believe that BHS has a second- ary and confused blend, in which a form close to the Pali, meaning <i>recall</i>, was adapted to the word meaning <i>extract,</i> <i>remove</i>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=098">[098,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="आबृढ.html">◀ ābṛḍha</a></div><div id="next"><a href="आब्रहितव्य.html">ābrahitavya ▶</a></div></div>
