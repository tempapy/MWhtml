<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>traividya</b>, adj., and <b>°ya-tā</b>, noun (= Pali tevijja, °ja-tā), (state of) <i>possessing the three knowledges</i>. In Pali (see Childers s.v. vijjā and Lévi, Sutrāl. vii.9, note), these are either (1) knowledge that all is anicca, dukkha, anatta, or (2) knowledge of former births (pubbenivāsa), of the (future) rebirths of beings (cutūpapāta), and of the de- struction of the depravities (āsava-khaya); of these the first and the third are two of the <b>abhijñā</b> (Pali abhiññā), q.v., and the second results from another abhijñā, viz. divyacakṣus (see s.v. <b>upapāda</b>), so that these three abhijñā are identified in BHS as the three vidyā, AbhidhK. LaV-P. vii.108. So far as I have found, this second of the two Pali sets is the only one recognized in BHS, where the category is in any case of very restricted occurrence; I have failed to record it except in SP and LV. In SP only the adj. occurs, always associated with ṣaḍabhijña, <i>having the six</i> <b>abhijñā</b>, as in: te traividyāḥ ṣaḍabhijñā(ḥ)…SP 179.17 (prose), and in verses (always separate ṣaḍabhijña from traividya! text makes them cpd.) 90.7; 129.10; 150.2; 155.2; no such association in LV, where context never helps in interpretation; adj., traividya (voc.) LV 363.16 (vs); noun, traividyatādhigatā 350.14 (so read with best mss. for text traividyādh°); °dyatā daśabalena…prāptā 352.17; °tām anuprāptaṃ 353.13 (prose); the last suggests that in 426.13 (prose) it is necessary to em. to traividyatā- nuprāpta (text °dyānu°, no v.l.) ity ucyate (said of Buddha). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=260">[260,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="त्रैलोक्यविजय.html">◀ trailokyavijaya</a></div><div id="next"><a href="त्रैवैदिक.html">traivaidika ▶</a></div></div>
