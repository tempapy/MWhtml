There [Page564-a+ 71] seems no doubt that samaṅgī°, or °gi° (as app. always in Pali without v.l.), is the orig. form. In most Mv occur- rences, some or all mss. read samanvagī° or °gi°; this may well have been the first change, and have actually existed in the language; it will have been analyzed as based on an adj. *sam-anvaga, equivalent to Pali anvaga (also anvagata), for anuga(ta), with intrusive -a- by anal. of augmented verb forms, see CPD; no doubt the common synonym <b>samanvāgata</b> also helped in this creation. This was later modified to samanvaṅgī° (found in a single ms. at Mv i.31.6), the only BHS form outside of Mv (in five texts); it was doubtless analyzed as sam-anv-aṅgī°, cf. Skt. aṅgīkaroti and derivs., as well as <b>sam-aṅgin</b>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=563">[563,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="समन्या.html">◀ samanyā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="समन्वागत.html">samanvāgata ▶</a></div></div>
