<div id="definition"><ul><li>(<b>vimāna</b>, nt. and m., = Skt. id.; on use in Pali, see elaborate article in PTSD; even in Skt., see BR, it is not exclusively used of divine, nor yet of mobile, residences, but may apply to any luxurious dwelling-place, which in India would naturally include the surrounding grounds; see Mrs. Rhys Davids, Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon Part IV, 1942, p. vi: ‘…more than houses, in- cluding gardens, woods, lakes’ etc… ‘<i>estates</i> might have been more literally correct’, but she uses <i>mansions</i>; several times in Jm the word is applied to something located in woods and used by a king for amusement; Speyer <i>arbors</i>, pw 7.375 ‘etwa <i>Hain’</i>, but surely buildings seem to be involved: vimāna-deśeṣu Jm 182.22, 183.3; the king takes a siesta śrīmati °na-pradeśe 183.10; the king stays for a time śrīmati pravivikte °na-deśe 192.23; vane manoharo- dyāna-°na-bhūṣite 208.20. Pali certainly also uses the word, as does Skt. more commonly, of the air-traveling palaces of the gods; and I question whether either Pali or BHS gives it any meaning which could not be matched in Skt. On Divy 399.18, where pw also sees the meaning <i>Hain</i>, see <b>Śairīṣaka</b>; nothing in the context suggests any reason for departure from the common meaning, <i>celestial</i>, and no doubt <i>mobile, palace</i>.) <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=496">[496,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="विमात्र्य.html">◀ vimātrya</a></div><div id="next"><a href="विमानराजन्.html">vimānarājan ▶</a></div></div>
