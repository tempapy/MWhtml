<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Amarā, (1)</b> n. of a smith's daughter (= later Yaśo- dharā), who married Mahauṣadha; heroine of a Jātaka which = the Pali Sūci-j., No. 387: Mv ii.83.19 ff.; colo- phon 89.11 Amarāye karmāradhītāye jātakam. In the Sūci-j. the characters are unnamed; but (Pali) Mahosadha [Page063-a+ 71] is the hero of the Mahāummagga-j., No. 546, and Amarā is his wife. This has misled both CPD and DPPN into identifying <i>this</i> Pali Jātaka with the story of Mv. Actually the stories are quite different, and Mv agrees with the Sūci-j., which, to be sure, acc. to the Story of the Present, belongs to the same occasion as the Mahāummagga; hence doubtless the transfer of the names of the hero and heroine from one to the other. Which was the original? (<b>2</b>) n. of a river: Māy 253.6; in a list between Viśvāmitrā and Tāmarā; not in Kirfel; perhaps read Amalā? (but this also is not recorded as a river-name). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=062">[062,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अमरपर्पट.html">◀ amaraparpaṭa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अमलगर्भ.html">amalagarbha ▶</a></div></div>
