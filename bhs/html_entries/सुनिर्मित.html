<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Sunirmita, (1)</b> m. (= Pali Sunimmita, cf. DN i.219.4), n. of the chief of the <b>nirmāṇarati</b> (also called <b>nirmita</b>) gods: LV 44.10; 59.6; 302.6; 362.18; 363.19; 441.18; Mv i.208.13; 263.16; ii.11.1; iii.315.7; Divy 140.15; Mmk 45.8; 69.6; Bbh 345.22 (in Mvy <b>Sunirmāṇarati</b>, q.v.); most occurrences which seem to suggest use in pl., as of the class of nirmita (= nirmāṇarati) gods, are only apparent, see s.v. <b>Suyāma</b> for a number of cases in Gv, Dbh.g., and RP. However, I have noted two cases where the pl. seems unquestionable (unless we resort to emenda- tion), and can only mean the class of which (the sg.) Sunirmita is chief: sunirmitāṃ devaputrāṃ paśyati ca svalaṃkṛtāṃ Mv ii.360.4 (vs); and, in a list of classes of gods, …sunirmitā paranirmitā śuddhāvāsā tuṣitā yāmā… Mmk 19.12 (prose). (But in LV 241.2, for Sunirmiteṣu, read with best ms. Sunirmito sa, supported by Tib.) Perhaps the fact that nirmita is used of the class, but less regularly than nirmāṇarati, led to occasional confusion with the name of its chieftain: (<b>2</b>) nt., n. of a buddhakṣetra: Mv i.123.6 (vs); located in the east. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=599">[599,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="सुनिर्माणरति.html">◀ sunirmāṇarati</a></div><div id="next"><a href="सुनिर्मितध्वजप्रदीप.html">sunirmitadhvajapradīpa ▶</a></div></div>
