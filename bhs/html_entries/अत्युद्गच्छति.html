<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>atyudgacchati</b>, and ppp. <b>atyudgata</b>, sometimes in texts and oftener in mss. (frequently as v.l.) for <b>abhyud°</b> in meaning <i>rises</i> (ppp. <i>risen</i>) <i>above</i>. Graphic confusion is certainly concerned here, at least in part; except as under <b>atyudgata</b>, q.v., all occurrences are grouped under <b>abhyud°</b>, q.v. For the most part Pali abbhuggacchati and derivatives support this classification. Note however (aside from Pali accuggata, apparently only used as adjec- tive, often with specialized meanings) Pali accuggamma, ger., used of water-plants, <i>having grown out above</i> (the water, acc. or abl.); but BHS uses (only) abhyudgacchati in this sense, according to unanimous tradition, tho perhaps this tradition may be erroneous. Contrariwise, there is even in Pali tradition some confusion between abbhugg- and accugg- in this group; see CPD s.v. abbhug- gata (a var. accuggata occurs with subject yaso). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=011">[011,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अत्युत्साहता.html">◀ atyutsāhatā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अत्युद्गत.html">atyudgata ▶</a></div></div>
