<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>kṛtya, (1)</b> m., a kind of demon (cf. Skt. kṛtyā, of which this may be a masc. correspondent created for the nonce, in this passage which is a list of masc. evil spirits): SP 401.5--6 kṛtyo vā vetāḍo vā…(6) yakṣakṛtyo vāmanu- ṣyakṛtyo vā manuṣyakṛtyo vā; (<b>2</b>) nt., or at end of adj. cpds., <i>business</i> etc., in some cases apparently transcending normal Skt. usage; bhakta-kṛtya (= Pali bhatta-kicca), lit. <i>business of food</i>, so <i>a meal</i>: Divy 185.22 °tyaṃ kartum ārabdhaḥ; āhāra-kṛtya, id., Divy 82.26 nānenāhāreṇāhāra- kṛtyaṃ kariṣyati, <i>he will not make his meal(s) on this food</i>, i.e. live on this alone; Divy 236.6, text āhāraṃ (read °ra-?) kṛtyaṃ kuru, <i>get your sustenance</i>; acc. to Senart, note on Mv i.349.18 (p. 622), used like the Pkt. quasi- suffix -kera(ka) as substantial equivalent of gen. case- ending (Pkt. -kera is to be derived from Skt. kārya with Pischel 176; see <b>-keraka</b>); Senart's Index further inter- prets -kṛtye ii.97.13 as ‘periphrasis for instrumental’, but this is certainly wrong, since there gītakṛtye pramattā jaladardarake ca clearly means <i>careless in their occupation</i> <i>with singing and the</i> (musical instrument) <i>jaladardaraka</i>; the cases where -kṛtya is alleged to be a ‘periphrasis for the gen.’ are also, in some cases, doubtful; in Mv i.349.18 and 350.1 Senart rāja-kṛtyā kośāto, supposedly = <i>from</i> <i>the king's treasury</i>, but the mss. read rāja-kṛto or (v.l. in 349.18) °kṛtāto, and the latter, at least, could be inter- preted (<i>the treasury made by the king</i>); ii.95.4 rājakṛtyato (abl.; v.l. °tāṃ) odhṛtabhāro, <i>having laid down the burden</i> <i>of</i> (lit. <i>from, away from</i>) <i>royal duty</i>; in ii.446.14 rājakṛtye siṃhāsane rājeti kṛtva (°tvä?) upaviśāpito, <i>he</i> (who was actually not the king) <i>was caused to sit upon the throne</i> <i>which was appropriate</i> (really belonged) <i>to the king</i>; ii.478.10 rājakṛtye (v.l. °kṛte) mahānase, and 12 rājakṛtyehi sūpehi, as in prec.; Senart's interpretation may however be substantially correct in the last three, and in ii.113.9 rājakṛtyaṃ udyānaṃ, <i>the park that belonged to the king</i>. Since Skt. kṛtya is in fact a synonym of kārya in some of its uses, the comparison with Pkt. -kera(ka), from Skt. kārya, is apposite. But the two alleged parallels from LV cited by Senart in his note, above, are not sound; one rests on a false reading of the Calcutta ed., and the other is to be interpreted otherwise. (<b>3</b>) -kṛtya, -kṛtyaṃ, = <b>-kṛtvā</b> for Skt. -kṛtvas, q.v. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=190">[190,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कृत्तिम.html">◀ kṛttima</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कृत्यक.html">kṛtyaka ▶</a></div></div>
