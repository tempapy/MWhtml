<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>? svayaṃ</b>, interpreted by Senart twice as prior mem- ber of cpds. in mg. <i>own</i>, = Skt. sva(ka), adj., for which saya, adj., is common in AMg.; I could hardly accept Senart's interpretation except on the assumption that the word is a form of that MIndic adj.; cf. conversely <b>svakam</b>, acc. to Senart = svayam. I can however not regard the interpretation as certain. In Mv i.284.4 (prose), kumāro brahmacārī svayam (perh. svaya-with m Hiatus-bridger?)- āśrame (mss. °maṃ) paryaṅkena niṣaṇṇo, svayam could be taken in its ordinary Skt. sense, <i>(the youth) himself</i>, rather than <i>in his own hermitage</i> with Senart. In i.302.6 (prose), Senart by em. svayaṃdhītā saṃveditā, <i>he spoke</i> <i>to his own daughter</i>; if it means this, I should read svayā, or (Skt.) svakā, or possibly svaya- (in comp.), dhītā; the [Page616-a+ 71] mss. read svajanaṃ dhītā saṃviditā; could this (taking svajanaṃ as nom.) mean <i>his people</i> (and specifically) <i>his</i> <i>daughter was admonished?</i> Undoubtedly his daughter alone is actually addressed in the following, evaṃ tuvaṃ…; and cf. svakā dhītā 304.8, in the verse version of the story; on the whole the mg. assumed by Senart is prob. to be accepted, but I question the form (= Skt. svayam). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=615">[615,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="स्वभासीभवति.html">◀ svabhāsībhavati</a></div><div id="next"><a href="स्वयंकारिन्.html">svayaṃkārin ▶</a></div></div>
