<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>? dardurā</b> (most mss. dardarā), sc. lipi, a kind of script: Mv i.135.7. Senart's note mentions this as one of the forms in the list which ‘ne laissent guère d'incertitude’; to me it is by no means clear. Did Senart mean to associate it with the Skt. name of the mountain range, often asso- ciated with Malaya? As a mountain name. Dardara (rare and doubtful in Skt., but in Pali Daddara) would merit consideration, as supported by most mss. But one would not expect a mountain-name here. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=262">[262,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="दर्दुर.html">◀ dardura</a></div><div id="next"><a href="दर्दुल.html">dardula ▶</a></div></div>
