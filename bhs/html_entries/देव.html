<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>deva</b> (Skt.), often also <b>devaputra</b> (rare in Skt., com- mon in Pali devaputta), <i>god</i>. More or less complete and corresponding lists of the classes of Buddhist gods are given in Pali in MN iii.100 ff.; Kvu 207, 208; Abhidh-s. (here called Abh) 21; Childers (Ch) 467 has a list nearly agreeing with the last; in BHS, in Mvy 3075 ff.; Dharmas 127 ff.; Mv (1) ii.314.4 ff.; (2) 348.16 ff.; LV 150.2 ff.; Av i.5.1 ff. (et alibi); Divy (1) 68.12 ff.; (2) 138.19 ff.; (3) 367.9 ff.; (4) 568.24 ff.; Bbh 61.27 ff.; Gv 249.10 ff. (the last in reverse order). There are other lists, mostly fragmentary, and often so confused as to be hardly usable. The gods fall into three grand divisions: <b>kāmāvacara</b>, living in the <b>kāmadhātu</b> (cf. Mvy 3071--4), usually six in number; <b>rūpāvacara</b>, in the <b>rūpadhātu; ārūpyāva-</b> <b>cara</b>, in the <b>ārūpyadhātu</b>. Cf. also the 9 <b>sattvāvāsa</b>, Mvy 2288 ff. (Pali DN 3.263). -- <b>Kāmāvacara</b> (deva). The standard list is: <b>cāturmahārājika</b> (BHS sometimes cat°); often <b>°rājakāyika</b>, so in Mvy, Dharmas, Divy 2, Bbh; <b>trāyastriṃśa</b> (Av, Divy, Bbh, <b>trayas°</b>); <b>yāma</b> (Bbh yama); <b>tuṣita</b> (in Dharmas before yāma); <b>nir-</b> <b>māṇarati</b> (see also <b>nirmita</b>); <b>paranirmitavaśavartin</b>. The Gv list omits 1 and 2. Before 1, Mvy inserts <b>bhauma</b> and <b>āntarikṣavāsin</b>, making 8 instead of 6. So Mv 2 prefixes bhūmyāṃ (see s.v. <b>bhūmi</b>) va carā (devāḥ; so read with mss.; va = eva) and <b>antarīkṣecarā</b>(ḥ). While no other of the above lists has these two items, <b>bhauma</b> and <b>antarīkṣa</b> (or <b>antarikṣa</b>; adjective) devas are asso- ciated with shorter lists (generally of kāmāvacara, or some of them, alone) in LV 266.1; 367.7 and 368.3; 396.14; 401.1; and correspondingly <b>bhūmya</b> and <b>antarīkṣecara</b> (deva) in Mv i.40.14; 229.14, 15; 240.3, 4; ii.138.12 and elsewhere. --<b>Rūpāvacara</b> (deva) dwell in the rūpadhātu (Mvy 3073), divided into the four <b>dhyāna-</b>bhūmi (Mvy 3084 ff., see <b>dhyāna</b>), the last of which includes, as its final and highest group, the <b>śuddhāvāsakāyika</b> gods, in five sub-groups. These being counted separately, the standard list of rūpāvacara contains usually 18 items in BHS, 16 in Pali, as follows. First dhyāna-bhūmi, usually 4 items, in Pali 3: <b>brahmakāyika</b> (not in Pali lists, but the word occurs, acc. to Childers as an inclusive term for the classes of the first dhyāna-bhūmi; perhaps rather for all the rūpāvacara, or for them plus the arūpāvacara, since they all inhabit brahmalokas, Childers s.v.; in Gv also omitted; in Mv put second, <b>brahmā</b> (devā) being first in Mv 1, and <b>mahābrahmā</b> in Mv 2); <b>brahma-</b> <b>pāriṣadya</b> (Dharmas, LV, Divy 4 <b>°pārṣadya</b>, Gv <b>°pār-</b> <b>ṣada</b>; om. Mv 1, Divy 1--3, Av, Bbh; after brahmapurohita in Dharmas, LV, Mv 2, Divy 4; our order is that of Mvy, [Page270-b+ 71] Gv, Pali); <b>brahmapurohita</b> (Gv omits brahma by haplo- graphy), <b>mahābrahman</b> (or °hma; as no. 1 in Mv 2). Second dhyāna-bhūmi, regularly 3 items in BHS and Pali; but Mv 1 and 2 and Pali MN iii.102.25 prefix another, <b>ābhā(ḥ)</b> (misprinted abhā in MN) devā(ḥ): <b>parīttābha</b> (Divy 1--3 mss. <b>parītā°</b>; Mv 1 omits); <b>apramāṇābha</b> (Mv 1 omits); <b>ābhāsvara</b> (Divy 3 <b>apramāṇābhāsvara</b>). Third dhyāna-bhūmi, regularly 3 items in BHS and Pali; Mv and Pali MN iii.102.30 add another, <b>śubhā</b> devāḥ (Pali subhā devā): <b>parīttaśubha</b> (Mv 2 omits); <b>apra-</b> <b>māṇaśubha</b> (Dharmas omits), <b>śubhakṛtsna</b>. Fourth dhyāna-bhūmi, usually three items in BHS, one in Pali, plus (sometimes app. included in the 4th dhy. bh. but sometimes not, cf. Childers s.v. jhānaṃ) the five śud- dhāvāsa(kāyika), who are usually not given this separate group-designation in the lists (but are so designated e.g. in Mvy 3101 and Abh): <b>anabhraka</b> (Pali and Mv omit); <b>puṇyaprasava</b> (Pali and Mv omit); <b>vṛhatphala</b> (so only Mvy and Mv 2 in BHS, others <b>bṛh°</b>, but Pali vehapphala); only in Dharmas, LV, and Abh of Pali there follows <b>asaṃjñisattva</b>, Pali (Abh) asaññasatta, a term which occurs as the 5th sattāvāsa in the Pali list of these DN iii.263.9 ff. (preceding the arūpadhātu), while in the cor- responding list of 9 sattvāvāsa in Mvy (2297) it is made the 9th and highest, above the arūpadhātu (an obvious error of Mvy); this item is also given in Childers's list and is needed to make up the traditional Pali number of 16 rūpa-brahmaloka. Then all lists have the five <b>śuddhā-</b> <b>vāsakāyika: avṛha</b> (Av, Divy 1--3, Bbh <b>abṛha</b>, Gv <b>abṛhat</b>); <b>atapa</b> (Gv atapo, as s-stem); <b>sudṛśa</b> (Mv 1 omits); <b>sudarśana</b> (Mv 2 omits; Divy 1 <b>sudarśa</b>); <b>akaniṣṭha</b> (for the Pali forms see these words). Here Mvy alone adds as additional stages of śuddhāvāsakāyika, <b>aghaniṣṭha</b> and <b>mahāmaheśvarāyatanam</b> (see these words). -- The <b>ārūpyāvacara</b> gods dwell in the four <b>ārūpyadhātu</b> bhūmi listed (only in Mvy and Dharmas, and in Pali MN, Abh. and Childers) as <b>ākāśānantyā-</b> <b>yatana, vijñānānantyāyatana, ākiṃcanyāyatana</b>, and <b>naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana</b>; the gods dwelling in them are described in Dharmas as <b>°āyatanopagāḥ</b> (see s.v. <b>upaga</b>; similarly Pali °āyatanūpagā). In Suv 86.11 ff., curiously, the first three ‘stages’, ending °āyatana, are personified as gods (°āyatanānāṃ koṭiśataṃ), while only with the last °āyatanopagatānāṃ (for °nopagānāṃ) is used. The first of the four is found in the Pali Kvu list also.
