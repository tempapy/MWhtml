<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>dhyāna</b>, nt. (Skt. id.; in technical sense = Pali jhāna), lit. <i>meditation</i> or <i>contemplation; mystic ‘trance’</i>; Lévi (Sūtrāl.) <i>extase</i>. Normally <i>four</i>, as in Pali, described in some detail in a long ancient passage (the Pali form, virtually identical, cited in Childers), found with hardly a true variant LV 129.1--11; 343.14--344.4; Mv i.228.3--10; ii.131.16--132.5; Mvy 1478--1481; an abbreviated form, giving the central points, as follows: savitarkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ prītisukham iti prathamadhyānaṃ, adhyātma- [Page287-b+ 71] pramodanāt prītisukham iti dvitīyaṃ, upekṣāsmṛtisaṃ- prajanyaṃ sukham iti tṛtīyaṃ, upekṣāsmṛtipariśuddhir aduḥkhāsukhā vedaneti caturthaṃ dhyānam iti Dharmas 72; they are the first four of the nine <b>anupūrvavihāra-</b> <b>(-samāpatti)</b>, qq.v.; these are related to the four dhyāna- bhūmi constituted or occupied by the various classes of <b>rūpāvacara</b> gods (see <b>deva</b>), as explained by Childers, in that attainment in worldly life of (various stages of adeptness in) each of the four dhyāna leads to rebirth in successively higher stages among these gods; catu-dhyāna- (meter proves single initial consonant pronounced for written dhy-)-dhyāyino (as before) SP 131.5 (vs); <i>three</i> dhyāna, listed as sadoṣāpakarṣa-, sukhavaihārika-, and aśeṣavaibhūṣita- (read <b>°vaibhūtika-?</b> see this word), Dharmas 109; I have found no other trace of this list; the names sound vaguely as if the first might apply to the first of the 4 dhyāna, the second to the 2d and 3d combined, and the third to the 4th; in Laṅk 10.11 na ṣaḍdhyānādidhyāyinā (tvayā bhavitavyam), <i>you should not</i> <i>meditate on such things as the six dhyāna</i>; apparently some reprehended practices are meant, but I have no more idea of the specific meaning than had Suzuki (Studies, 414). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=287">[287,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="ध्यातक.html">◀ dhyātaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="ध्यानगोचर.html">dhyānagocara ▶</a></div></div>
