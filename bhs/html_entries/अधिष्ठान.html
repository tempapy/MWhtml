<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>adhiṣṭhāna</b>, (regularly) nt. (= Pali adhiṭṭhāna; see 6 below for forms of other genders; from <b>adhitiṣṭhati</b>, q.v.), (<b>1</b>) <i>basis</i>, as in Skt. (BR s.v. 1); special usage, SP 405.8--9 (a Buddha of old preached the SP at length) Sarvasattvapriyadarśanaṃ bodhisattvaṃ…adhiṣṭhānaṃ kṛtvā, <i>making</i> (his disciple) <i>the Bodhisattva S. the basis</i>, i.e. with special regard to him, or for his special benefit; (<b>2</b>) (mental) <i>firm basis = determination, resolve, resolution, vow</i>, = Pali (cetaso) adhiṭṭhāna (see CPD); rare in BHS: (a Bodhisattva is about to burn his body to honor the SP and the Buddha who revealed it to him; having purified, adorned, and scented his body) svakam adhiṣṭhānam akarot SP 407.6, <i>he made his resolution, firm mental determination</i>; followed by svakam adhiṣṭhānaṃ kṛtvā svaṃ kāyaṃ prajvālayām āsa; buddhān bhagavataḥ sākṣiṇaḥ kṛtvā teṣāṃ purataḥ satyādhiṣṭhānaṃ (q.v.) karomi: yena satyena etc., SP 413.7--8,…<i>I make a truthful resolve…</i> and he proceeds with an ‘act of truth’, see <b>satyavacana</b>; (?) LV 423.5-6 akṣaṇasattvavinayādhiṣṭhānāpratyudāvar- tyacakraṃ (said of the dharmacakra; text °dhiṣṭhāna- praty°, but see s.v. <b>apratyudāvartya</b>), <i>wheel that cannot</i> <i>be turned back because of</i> (the Buddha's) <i>fixed determination</i> <i>to discipline creatures that are subject to bad births</i> (? or possibly <i>because of the Buddha's supernatural power to</i> <i>discipline</i> etc.; otherwise, implausibly, Foucaux); here perhaps also the ‘four adhisthāna’ (<i>firm resolves?</i>) of Mvy 1580--84 (satya-, tyāga-, upasama-, prajñā-) = Pali four [Page016-a+ 71] adhiṭṭhāna, DN iii.229.18 (paññā-, sacca-, cāga-, upasama-); (<b>3</b>) in Skt. (BR s.v. 2) <i>mastery, power</i>; in BHS <i>control</i>, e.g. of a monk's own robes (cf. <b>adhitiṣṭhati</b> 1), MSV ii.91.12 tricīvarādhiṣṭhānena; oftener <i>supernatural, magic</i> <i>power</i>: puṇyavipākādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitās LV 48.21 (Apsa- rases) <i>empowered</i> (controlled) <i>by the power of the ripening of</i> <i>merit</i> (which enables them to disappear from their heavenly home and appear in Kapilavastu); -devatādhiṣṭhānāt LV 381.12, <i>by the magic power of the…deity</i> (the merchants' wagons were stopped and could not be moved); usually a Buddha's or Bodhisattva's; it may be his <i>supernatural</i> <i>control</i> over his own destiny, SP 64.13, where bodhisattvā- dhiṣṭhānena goes closely with tat paurvakaṃ caryāpraṇi- dhānam, see s.v. <b>saṃmantrita</b>; but it is usually <i>control</i> over another person, a Bodhisattva or disciple: Maitreyasya bodhisattvasyādhiṣṭhānabalena sarveṣu teṣu kūṭāgāreṣv abhyantarapraviṣṭam ātmānaṃ saṃjānīte sma, Gv 512.13- 14, <i>by the force of the supernatural power of Maitreya</i> (Sudhana) <i>fancied that he had entered into each one of those</i> <i>palaces</i>; buddhānāṃ…adhiṣṭhānena LV 163.9--10 (text adhisthān°; when the women were making music for the Bodhisattva) <i>by the supernatural power of the Buddhas</i> verses of exhortation to him came forth (in 163.14 <b>āveśa</b>, q.v., or v.l. ādeśa, replaces adhi°); similarly 182.3; adhi- ṣṭhānena buddhānām anubhāvād (another near-synonym) vikurvitaiḥ Samādh 22.19 (the body of the Buddha can be seen); other like cases Laṅk 2.10; LV 31.3, 6; 237.18; 368.12; in 415.16, the dharmacakra is sarvabuddhādhiṣ- ṭhānāvilopitam, <i>unbroken thru the supernatural power</i> (influence) <i>of all the Buddhas</i>; for Laṅk 100.6 and Mmk 56.24 see s.v. <b>adhitiṣṭhati</b> (2); etaṃ…samādhiṃ samā- pannasyādhiṣṭhānam: lokadhātuvijñaptiṣu adhiṣṭhānam, etc., long series of locs. each with adhi° repeated, stating the spheres of the <i>mastery</i> obtained, Gv 98.15 ff.; mamā- dhiṣṭhānabalādhānam SP 316.1, <i>my assumption of the force</i> <i>of supernatural</i> (magic) <i>power</i> (here causes people to believe that the earthly life of Śākyamuni, which was unreal, is real); but the corresponding verse, 323.13, has adhiṣṭha- hāmi in the sense of <i>I make appear by magic</i> (see <b>adhitiṣ-</b> <b>ṭhati</b> 3), and possibly adhiṣṭhāna may be concrete here (and in sadādhiṣṭhānaṃ mama etad īdṛśaṃ SP 324.11, resuming the same subject), <i>exhibition of supernatural</i> (magic) <i>power = magical appearance</i> or <i>transformation</i>; this latter is certainly the meaning in LV 379.3, see <b>adhitiṣṭhati</b> (3), and perhaps in Prabhūtaratnasya tathāgatasya…etad adhiṣṭhānam abhūt SP 241.8, <i>this</i> <i>was the adhiṣṭhāna of the Tathāgata P</i>. (there follows a quotation of his words: <i>Let this stūpa of my remains appear</i> <i>whenever the SP is preached</i>). Does <i>this adhiṣṭhāna</i> mean <i>this exhibition of supernatural power</i>, viz, the making of the stūpa to appear? Or is it <i>this fixed determination, resolution</i> (2, above)? Near synonyms are <b>āveśa</b>, (Skt.) anubhāva, <b>adhimukti</b>; cf. also Laṅk 292.13 and 15, where one of the sources of abhijñā is ‘from adhiṣṭhāna’ (adhiṣṭhānān, so read in 13 for text °nāṃ, abl., before n-), which means <i>from the controlling power of the Buddhas</i> and is paraphrased in 15 by buddhaprasādataḥ, <i>from the grace of the Buddhas</i>. Suzuki, Transl. of Laṅk passim, renders <i>sustaining power</i>; I think rather <i>controlling power</i>. Even Bodhisattvas are at times dependent on Buddhas and need their control; (<b>4</b>) in architecture, Skt. (see Acharya, Dict. Hindu Arch. s.v.), <i>basement, foundation</i> of building or <i>base</i> of a pillar. Here in Mvy 5591 = Tib. lan kan gyi rten ma, <i>prop</i> (i.e. base) <i>of a railing</i>; so Chin. Whatever it means here is certainly meant also in Divy 221.9, 10 adhiṣṭhānam, and Mv i.195.1 ff.; iii.227.8 ff., adhiṣṭhānakam, where the context is the same as in Mvy 5591; see <b>sūcī, sūcikā;</b> <b>(5)</b> see <b>pādādhiṣṭhāna; (6)</b> m., n. of a (mythical) samādhi: Gv 451.26. In this curious passage, 451.25--452.6, the word adhiṣṭhāna is further used predicatively in a series of equational sentences, varying in gender like an adjective [Page016-b+ 71] with different subjects. Bhadrottamā says to Sudhana: ahaṃ kulaputrā 'nālayamaṇḍalaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ jānāmi deśayāmy, adhiṣṭhānaś ca me samādhiḥ pratilab- dho; na tatra samādhau kasyacid dharmasyā 'dhiṣṭhānam; adhiṣṭhānaṃ tatra sarvajñatācakṣuḥ pravartate, 'dhiṣṭhā- naṃ sarvajñatāśrotram, adhiṣṭhānaṃ sarvajñatāghrāṇam, adhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatājihvā, 'dhiṣṭhānaḥ sarvajñatākāyo, 'dhiṣṭhānaṃ tatra sarvajñatāmanaḥ pravartate, 'dhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatormir, adhiṣṭhānā sarvajñatāvidyud, adhiṣṭhānāḥ sarvajñatāvegāḥ pravartante jagadrocanāmaṇḍalāḥ; etam ahaṃ kulaputrā 'nālayamaṇḍalaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ jā- nāmi.(Punctuation introduced by me.) There is no further light from the context. I am not sure what meaning the author attributed to the word adhiṣṭhāna: presumably something like either <i>basis</i> or <i>controlling power</i>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=015">[015,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अधिष्ठहति.html">◀ adhiṣṭhahati</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अधिष्ठानक.html">adhiṣṭhānaka ▶</a></div></div>
