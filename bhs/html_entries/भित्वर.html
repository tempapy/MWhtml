<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>bhit(t)vara</b>, adj., <i>ruined, broken-down</i>: (of a house,) read bhitvara (with ms. Ḱ) or °ru (with 3 mss., KN) in SP 85.4 (vs), for durbalam of both edd., which the preceding and parallel sudurbalaṃ makes improbable; Tib. ḥjig (ñe) supports a form of bhid-; read for the next word bhairavaṃ, with all Nep. mss. of KN, also Ḱ, and Tib. ḥjigs, for KN's em. itvara; this word (q.v.) is inappropriate here, yet similar enough in mg. to have helped in the creation of bhit(t)vara, as if bhid- plus tvara, modelled on i-tvara and Skt. ga-tvara; the latter has a mg. virtually identical with that required here. Is this the word intended by vidvarena (vi = bhi repea- tedly here) in Dutreuil, C fragm. XIIIvo, for which Pali SN i.131.11 has bhindanena, v.l. °rena? See Barua and Mitra 211, 213. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=409">[409,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="भित्तीफलक.html">◀ bhittīphalaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="भिरु.html">bhiru ▶</a></div></div>
