<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>uttari</b> (apparently the usual form; also <b>uttarī</b>, chiefly if not wholly m.c.; <b>uttariṃ</b>, once <b>uttarīṃ; uttare,</b> <b>°reṇa</b>; possibly <b>uttaraṃ</b>, but use of this as separate adv. uncertain; in prior part of cpds. uttari-, °re-, °raṃ-, besides normal Skt. uttara-; Pali apparently only uttariṃ as separate word, uttari- in prior part of cpds, besides uttara-) adv., and prep. or postposition with abl. or gen., <i>further, beyond</i>, of time, space, number, etc.; synonym of bhūyas; all the forms enumerated seem to be equivalent and interchangeable to the extent indicated above; none seem recorded in these uses in Skt. or Pkt. acc. to the dictionaries; once uttarī may be intended as n. sg. m. of an adj., Bbh 102.15 (prose) na ebhya uttarī na ebhyo bhūyān anyo hetur vidyate, <i>no other cause is found beyond</i> <i>these, greater than these</i> (cf. the next passages); with de- pendent abl., usually atas, tatas: nāsty ata uttari nāsty ato bhūyaḥ (cf. prec.)

A, other mss. °ri, unmetr.; Calc. <b>°rī</b>, perhaps rightly) vā, <i>how could</i> <i>there be one higher</i> (prob. adverb); [in Mv ii.243.7 (prose) ed. tasya pañjarasya uttariṃ sthitvā, but read with v.l. upari, <i>on top of the cage</i>; this mg. is not found for uttari(ṃ);] in composition, uttari-jñāna-viśeṣasūcanatāyai Gv 191.11 (prose; apparently substantially = uttara); note esp. [Page124-a+ 71] uttarottari-(v.l. °ra-)-viśiṣṭatara-kuśalamūla- LV 429.14 (prose), <i>more and more exceedingly superior roots of merit</i>; (ekam pudgalaṃ sthāpayitvā) śaikṣapratipady uttari- karanīyaṃ Sukh 2.13 (prose), (except one person) <i>who</i> <i>had something left to do in the śaikṣa course</i> (the rest all being arhats); note that Pali has the same cpd. uttari- karaṇīya, but acc. to PTSD only as a karmadharaya, <i>an additional duty</i>, not as a bahuvrīhi as here; in some of the above it is not certain whether uttari- is compounded with the following word or a separate adverb; in LV 246.16; 263.11, above, uttari must be prep., governing manuṣyadharmād; to these passages correspond Mv ii.121.7, 12; 122.2 uttari-manuṣyadharmasya jñānāye darśanāye saṃbodhāye; Senart takes the word as a cpd., depending on jñānāye etc., prob. rightly, tho the gen. manuṣyadharmasya might be dependent on prep. uttari; the latter construction is impossible, and a cpd. (= Pali uttarimanussadhamma, <i>superhuman faculties</i> or <i>conditions</i>; the analysis of the Pali comm. cited by Childers is incon- sistent with that indicated by LV 246.16 and 263.11) must be assumed in Mv ii.130.12 kaṃcid uttarimanuṣya- dharmaṃ; Divy 145.21, 28 and 146.16 uttarimanuṣya- dharme (so with mss., ed. wrongly em. uttare man°); Śikṣ 62.4 uttarimanuṣyadharmair; besides this, the same cpd. is recorded in BHS (not in Pali) as uttara-manuṣya- dharma-(-pralāpa, m.), Mvy 8367, <i>declaring</i> (falsely the possession of) <i>superhuman faculties</i> (one of the <b>parajika</b> sins); also uttaraṃ-man° Divy 144.4, 28; 145.18 (mss., in 144.4 ed. em. °re); Bhīk 26a.3; uttare-man° Divy 144.9, 13, 21, 23, 27; 145.3, 11, 13, 17; 146.8, 25 (in all these read as cpd.; ed. takes uttare as separate adj., misled by the fact that the cpd. is a loc., ending °dharme; see above for evidence that uttare = uttari as adv. and prep.); in Divy 144.5 apparently anuttare is used as synonym of uttare in this cpd. (taken by ed. as separate adj.), yady ekaṃ śramaṇo Gautamo 'nuttare-manuṣyadharme riddhi- prātihāryaṃ vidarśayiṣyati vayaṃ dve (see <b>anuttara</b>; but this word does not fit and must be either a cor- ruption, or a sign of misunderstanding by the author of the passage; elsewhere in the same passage only forms of uttara-, uttari- etc. are used). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=123">[123,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="उत्तरापथक.html">◀ uttarāpathaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="उत्तरिक.html">uttarika ▶</a></div></div>
