<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>indra-paṭa</b>, nt., acc. to pw 2.294, <i>Luftgewand</i>, so v.a. <i>Nacktheit</i>: °ṭaṃ śvetapaṭaṃ dhyuṣitapaṭaṃ Kv 81.6--7; but can indra- have this mg. (= <i>sky, air</i>, as in digambara)? I find no basis for the theory. All the context shows is that persons dressed in these garbs should not be con- secrated (dīkṣ). What the <i>garb of Indra (? of a prince)</i> means is not clear. It is true that śveta-paṭa is recorded as used of the Jain sect otherwise called śvetāmbara; doubtless this was the reason for Boehtlingk's conjecture, based on the assumption that this word equals digambara; but I doubt that this is sufficient to support it. That a real sort of cloth is meant is suggested by nānā-paṭeṣu, line 6. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=115">[115,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="इन्द्रध्वजकेतु.html">◀ indradhvajaketu</a></div><div id="next"><a href="इन्द्रपुर.html">indrapura ▶</a></div></div>
