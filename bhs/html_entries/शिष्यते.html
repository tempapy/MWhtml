<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>śiṣyate</b>, could be considered normal Skt. pass. to śās-, <i>is instructed, learns</i> (with acc.): (dārakasahasrāṇi…) lipiṃ °ante sma LV 127.4 (prose; all mss.; Calc. śikṣante). The prec. and foll. items show that, acc. to persistent tradition, LV (and esp. in this vicinity) uses forms in śiṣy- for Skt. and usual BHS śikṣ-; those which Weller notices he regards as mere corruptions for śikṣ- (41, line 1); but it is not impossible that the word śiṣya is concerned in some or all of them, even in this, which could be a denom. In śiṣyā(-pada), for śikṣā-, the influence of śiṣya could only have been exerted in secondary blending. These substitutions may also have phonetic aspects (ṣ for kh for kṣ, § 2.26). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=529">[529,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शिष्यण.html">◀ śiṣyaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शिष्ययति.html">śiṣyayati ▶</a></div></div>
