The next sentence says that Śakra brought harītakī, a purgative medicine, so that <i>his humors might become pacified, restored</i> <i>to ease</i>, dhātūnāṃ sukhaṃ (em. to mukhaṃ by Senart!) bhaviṣyati.The exact reading in 1 is uncertain; possibly tathā abhiṣyanditam, impersonal, <i>inflation, over-exuberance</i> (of humors) <i>was caused</i>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=057">[057,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अभिष्यन्द.html">◀ abhiṣyanda</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अभिष्यन्दन.html">abhiṣyandana ▶</a></div></div>
