<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>aśubha-bhāvanā</b>, f. pl. °nāḥ Mvy 1155; Bbh 98.18 (read aśubha-bhāvanā for ed. aśubhā-bh°); or <b>aśubha-</b> <b>saṃjñā</b>, Bhīk 27a.2 (= Pali asubha-bhāvanā or -saññā), see <b>saṃjñā</b>, <i>contemplation of offensive things</i>, specifically of human corpses in various states of disintegration; there are nine (in Pali, Vism. i.110.29--31 ten) such monkish disciplines, elsewhere called simply nava saṃjñāh, <i>the</i> <i>nine concepts</i> (of offensive things), ŚsP 59.1; 1258.5; a less schematized passage of the same sort in older Pali, MN i.58.9 ff. In Mvy 1156--64 they are listed, each cpd. with -saṃjñā: (1) <b>vinīlaka-</b>, (2) <b>vipūyaka-</b> (so read), (3) <b>vipaḍumaka-</b>, (4) <b>vyādhmātaka-</b>, (5) <b>vilohitaka-</b>, (6) <b>vikhāditaka-</b>, (7) <b>vikṣiptaka-</b>, (8) <b>vidagdhaka-</b>, (9) <b>asthi-saṃjñā</b> (see each of these). Bhīk 27a.2--3 agrees except that it transposes Nos. 5 and 6 and accidentally omits 8 (which perhaps should be put after 9; only Mvy has it before 9). There are three lists (one incomplete, [Page080-b+ 71] one very corrupt) in ŚsP 59.1 ff., 1258.5 ff., 1431.19 ff. (six items only; cited from the last, with only four items one of which is not in this ŚsP list, in Śikṣ 211.1). Barring corruptions, the ŚsP lists agree with Mvy and Bhīk ex- cept in order of the terms, in which they show some (slight) resemblance to the Pali (Vism.) arrangement. ŚsP 1 (Śikṣ 1) = Vism 1 = Mvy 4; ŚsP^3 (= 1431.19 ff.) 2 = Śikṣ 2 = Vism 2 = ŚsP^1 (= 59.1 ff.) and^2 (= 1258.5 ff.) 5 = Mvy 1; ŚsP and Śikṣ 3 = Vism 3 = Mvy 2; Śikṣ 4 (not in ŚsP^3) = ŚsP^1 and ^2 2 = Vism 9 = Mvy 3; ŚsP^1 and^2 4 = ŚsP^3 5 = Vism 8 = Mvy 5 (Bhīk 6); ŚsP^1 and^2 6 = ŚsP^3 4 = Vism 5 = Mvy 6 (Bhīk 5); ŚsP^1 and^2, Mvy 7 = ŚsP^3, Vism 6; ŚsP^1 and^2 8 = Vism 10 = Mvy 9; ŚsP^1 and ^2 9 = Mvy 8 (omitted in Bhīk; Vism 4 has a different term, vicchiddaka, <i>fissured</i> Pe Maung Tin; Vism 7 hata-vikkhittaka is variation on Vism 7 vikkhittaka = Mvy 7). On the meanings, as well as the variants and cor- ruptions, see the terms as listed above from Mvy. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=080">[080,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अशुभतसंज्ञि.html">◀ aśubhatasaṃjñi</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अशेष.html">aśeṣa ▶</a></div></div>
