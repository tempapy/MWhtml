<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>gṛhapati</b> (= Pali gahapati), lit. <i>householder</i>, in °ti- ratna, as one of the 7 ‘jewels’ of a cakravartin: LV 14.5; Mv i.49.4; 193.17, etc., see the lists s.v. <b>ratna</b> (3). The function of the gṛhapati-ratna is to discern the location of hidden treasures by means of the divya-cakṣus which he possesses, and bring those of them which are ownerless (asvāmika) into the possession of the king: LV 17.17--22; substantially the same statement in Pali, DN ii.176.7 ff. For this reason, no doubt, PTSD s.v. ratna translates gahapati by <i>treasurer</i>; but there is no clear evidence that he had precisely the functions which we should associate with that title. In Pali a gahapati (see PTSD s.v.) is, to be sure, often associated with seṭṭhi = śreṣṭhin; the Pali word is often rendered <i>treasurer</i>, but perhaps <i>capitalist</i> would be better (orig. <i>guild-leader</i>). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=214">[214,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="गृहतर.html">◀ gṛhatara</a></div><div id="next"><a href="गृहपतिक.html">gṛhapatika ▶</a></div></div>
