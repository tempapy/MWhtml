<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>kaṇaya</b> or <b>kanaya</b> (m. or nt.; = Pali id.; on Skt. see below), some kind of weapon, said to be a kind of <i>spear</i> or <i>lance</i>; occurs only in long cpds. consisting of lists of weapons of all kinds: -kaṇaya- LV 305.9 (no v.l.); 306.14 (-kan°, v.l. -kanapa-); 317.15 (several good mss. kanaya-); -kanaya- LV 218.12 (no v.l.). The form kaṇaya is recorded as v.l. for kaṇapa in some Skt. passages, BR 2.30, and twice without record of v.l. in late Skt., see Schmidt, Nachtr. The form kaṇapa is not very common in Skt. itself, see BR l.c. and pw; it is found Mbh.Cr. ed. 1.218.24 (Calc. 1.8257) and 3.83* (after 3.21.32 ab; Calc. 3.810 kaṇapa, Bomb. kanapa); no Mbh. ms. is recorded with ya for pa in either place. Yet it seems probable that the variation between y and p is purely graphic; Pali and BHS clearly support y, which even Skt. sometimes shows as v.l. for p and which may be the original (rela- tively very few occurrences are noted). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=165">[165,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कण.html">◀ kaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कणिम.html">kaṇima ▶</a></div></div>
