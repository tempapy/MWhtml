<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>adhitiṣṭhati</b>, also <b>adhiṣṭhahati, °ṣṭhihati</b> (and noun <b>adhiṣṭhāna</b>, q.v.; Pali adhitiṭṭhati, adhiṭṭhāna, in general in same meanings; previous translations of BHS vary widely and are hardly worth systematic quotation; very common is <i>bless</i>, which I think should be deleted, see below): (<b>1</b>) <i>masters, controls</i>, in normal Skt. (BR sthā with adhi 3, 4) and also BHS (exx. La Vallée Poussin, AbhidhK. vii.119 note 2, b); in BHS particularly <i>takes</i> <i>possession</i> or <i>control of</i>, MSV i.248.20 (sāptāhikaṃ), and ff.; Bhīk 15 a. 1 (the newly initiated nun says to her in- structress) samanvāhara upādhyāyike, aham…idaṃ cī- varaṃ saṃghāṭīm adhitiṣṭhāmi, <i>I take</i> (formal) <i>possession</i> <i>of my nun's garments</i> (similarly with other implements, below: Ridding p. 124 calls this rite <i>benediction</i> of the garments, etc.; but the nun is the only speaker; she would not ‘bless’ her own belongings!); in BHS (<b>2</b>) the power or control is usually <i>supernatural</i> or <i>magical</i>: adhitiṣṭhantu buddhā bhagavanto idaṃ paṭasūtram Mmk 56.12, <i>let the Lord Buddhas exercize their supernatural</i> <i>power over</i> (assume control of) <i>this thread</i> (Lalou, Icono- graphie p 20, <i>occupent</i>); in the sequel, favorable sounds show the performer that, adhiṣṭhitaṃ me buddhair… tat paṭasūtraṃ (17); he reflects, buddhānāṃ…adhiṣṭhā- nam etat (24), <i>this is the controlling power of the B</i>.; Laṅk [Page013-a+ 71] 100.6 ff., Bodhisattvas may be adhiṣṭhānadvayādhiṣṭhitāḥ, <i>controlled by two supernatural powers</i> (of Buddhas, cf. 11 buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitāḥ); these are (9) samādhisamā- pattyadhiṣṭhāna; <i>the control that gives attainment of samā-</i> <i>dhis</i> (cf. 12 samādhiṃ samāpadyante; to this verb <b>samā-</b> <b>patti</b>, q.v., is merely a noun of action; wrongly Suzuki), and sarvakāyamukhapāṇyabhiṣekādhiṣṭhāna, <i>the control</i> <i>that comes from sprinkling by</i> (the Buddha's) <i>hands of the</i> <i>whole body and face</i> (cf. 101.10--11); persons are said to be adhiṣṭhita, <i>supernaturally controlled</i> by Buddhas (may often be rendered <i>inspired</i>) SP 231.1; 238.2; 420.4; LV 275.2; Laṅk 4.13; cf. <b>adhiṣṭhāna</b>; this <i>control</i> often in- volves (<b>3</b>) <i>magic transformation</i>, and even the <i>creation of</i> <i>magic appearances</i>; not easily separated from the preced- ing; transitional is sarvabuddhādhiṣṭhito 'yaṃ…dharma- paryāyaḥ SP 288.13, <i>it is under the supernatural control</i> <i>of all the Buddhas</i> (hence marvelous effects for one who preaches it, as related above), with this cf. tasmāt tarhi …adhitiṣṭhāmīmaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ asmiñ jambudvīpe SP 421.2, <i>therefore I</i> (lit. <i>exercize supernatural power over</i> <i>this Dh</i>., which however here seems to mean) <i>make this</i> <i>Dh. appear in this J</i>. (with magical effects, some mentioned above, some in the next sentence); from such passages as this and SP 384.3, below, La Vallée Poussin, AbhidhK., Index, and esp. vii.119, note 2, derives the supposed meaning <i>faire durer</i>, but in iii.31, note 2, quoting the vyākhyā, he translates adhitiṣṭhati <i>bénit</i>, whereas it means <i>takes under control, assumes control of</i>; the meaning <i>bless</i>, assumed by Burnouf and many others, rests on Tib. byin kyi rlabs, which to be sure often means <i>bless</i>, but acc. to Jäschke also <i>create, change into</i>; this kind of change by magical mastery or control need not be a <i>blessing</i>, cf. (tā jarājarjarā) adhyatiṣṭhat LV 378.17, <i>he changed them</i> (the daughters of Māra, by magic control) <i>so as to be</i> <i>decrepit with age</i>, and later, buddhasya yo hy adhiṣṭhānaṃ śaknuyāt kartum anyathā 379.3, (I see no one) <i>who could</i> <i>alter a magic transformation of the Buddha</i>; mahābrahmā imaṃ…lokadhātuṃ tat kṣaṇaṃ samam adhyatiṣṭhat, pāṇitalajātam…tṛṇair imaṃ…lokadhātuṃ saṃchādi- tam adhyatiṣṭhat LV 276.19 ff., <i>the Great Brahmā magically</i> <i>mastered</i> (and thereby changed) <i>this entire world</i> (so as to be) <i>even</i>, etc.,…<i>covered with grass</i>; in SP 384.3 (as he was about to die, Sadāparibhūta heard this sūtra; then, not dying after all,) adhiṣṭhihitvā ca sudīrgham āyuḥ, <i>and having mastered, acquired, assumed by magic, very long</i> <i>life</i> (he proceeded to proclaim this sūtra; similar passages are taken by La Vallée Poussin l.c. to mean <i>faire durer</i>); (Bhagavān…) jīvitasaṃskārān adhiṣṭhāya āyuḥsaṃ- skārān utsraṣṭum ārabdhaḥ. samanantarādhiṣṭhiteṣu jīvita- saṃskāreṣu (omens occurred) Divy 203.7--8 (in this phrase LaV-P, AbhidhK. ii.122. renders <i>stabilisé</i>; note the term vaśitva in the comm., l.c. 124 line 1; render <i>controlling</i>), see <b>saṃskāra</b> 2; buddhā bhagavantaḥ taṃ pṛthivī- pradeśaṃ vajramayam adhitiṣṭhanti sma LV 86.16--17, …<i>magically made this spot of ground</i> (where the young Bodhisattva took seven steps) <i>hard as a diamond</i>, so that it did not sink under his feet (N.B. they did not literally <i>stand upon</i> it; they were located sthitāḥ line 16, in the ten quarters); tatrāpi cātmānam adhiṣṭhahāmi, sarvāṃś ca sattvān ah[am] adhiṣṭhihāmi (so read, § 8.99) SP 323.13, <i>there</i> (having made it appear that I entered nirvāṇa, tho I did not) <i>I make myself appear</i> (create myself magically, cf. 316.1, s.v. adhiṣṭhāna 3), <i>and I control all creatures</i> (in next line, <i>men of perverted minds were deluded and did</i> <i>not see me, tho I was standing right there</i>); with SP 384.3 cf. Dbh 91.28 sarvasattvāṃś ca ākāṅkṣan yathābhiprāyaṃ rūpāśrayālaṃkṛtān adhitiṣṭhati; in this section adhitiṣṭhati occurs many times, beginning with 90.21--22 saṃkṣiptāyā lokadhātor vistīrṇatām adhitiṣṭhati, and means always (a Bodhisattva in the tenth stage) <i>makes appear magically</i>, either by transformation or creation; cf. in Pali Therag.
