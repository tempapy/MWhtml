<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Amitābha, (1)</b> n. of the Buddha who presides over the western paradise <b>Sukhāvatī</b> (lokadhātu); also known as <b>Amitāyu(s), Amitaprabha, Amitanātha</b>, and doubt- less intended by the Mmk names <b>Amitāyu(rjñāna)-</b> <b>viniścayarājendra</b> (or the like), even tho he is once depicted separately in a painting centering about that personage (Mmk 305.12--13, cf. 304.25). See these names separately. The two commonest names are Amitābha and Amitāyus, and they are as a rule quite equivalent and interchangeable; see notably Sukh 62.13--14; 95.15 and 20. Often Sukhāvatī is mentioned with him. He is the fourth of the ‘transcendent’ Buddhas, Dharmas 3; Mvy 85. Other occurrences: Suv 2.5; Bhad 49, 57, 59, 62; Śikṣ 175.6; Kv 18.7; 21.8 etc.; Mmk 42.16; 426.7; Gv 82.5; Laṅk 283.7; Sukh 1.6; 28.10 etc.; Sādh 16.10 etc.; (<b>2</b>) n. of a Bodhisattva: Gv 442.22 (one of a long list, and hardly to be identified with the Buddha A.). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=063">[063,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अमिता.html">◀ amitā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अमितायु.html">amitāyu ▶</a></div></div>
