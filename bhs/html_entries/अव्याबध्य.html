<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>a-vyābadhya</b> or <b>°vadhya</b>, adj. and nt. subst. (see next, and cf. Pali avyāpajjha, as mentioned there), (<b>1</b>) adj., <i>that cannot be injured</i> or <i>disturbed, inviolable</i>: Mv ii.259.15 °dhyaṃ (ms.)…dharmaṃ deśayiṣyati; 279.9 °dhyaṃ arthaṃ prārthayamāno; in both of these spelled avyāvadhyaṃ, and associated with asādhāraṇaṃ; (<b>2</b>) ap- parently subst., <i>not doing harm</i> (so Tib., gnod pa mi byed): LV 380.17 avyābadhyaṃ (Foucaux <i>la mansuétude</i>) sukhaṃ loke. There is a v.l., in mss. usually regarded as the best, adhyāvadhya; one might conjecture a-vyā- vadhya, or °bādhya, ger., <i>not committing injury</i>. But the context suggests that a nom. sg. noun is intended, sukhaṃ being apparently predicate (Foucaux <i>douce</i>): so Tib. takes it. In all of these forms the root vadh may have been felt to be concerned; or the short a of the root may be semi-MIndic (based on forms of bādh which are cer- tainly commoner). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=079">[079,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अव्यापाद.html">◀ avyāpāda</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अव्याबाध.html">avyābādha ▶</a></div></div>
