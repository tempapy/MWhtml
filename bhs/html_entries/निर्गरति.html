<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>? nirgarati</b>, perhaps rather nirgalati, <i>spits out</i>: LV 306.21 (prose) nirgaranto; but best mss. nirgalanto; object ayoguḍāni, <i>spitting forth</i>. Cf. BR s.v. gal plus nis, nirgali- tāmbugarbhaṃ śaradghanam Ragh. 5.17, which could very well mean <i>an autumn cloud that has ejected its water-</i> <i>content</i>. On the other hand, nirgīrṇa is recorded in BR once from Rām. Neither nir-gṝ nor nir-gal seems recorded otherwise, in Skt. or MIndic. Since galati is the regular present to gal, it seems more likely that the best mss. of LV have the true form, nirgalanto. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=300">[300,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="निर्गड.html">◀ nirgaḍa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="निर्गूढ.html">nirgūḍha ▶</a></div></div>
