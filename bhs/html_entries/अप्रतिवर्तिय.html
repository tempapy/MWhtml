<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>a-prativartiya</b> (semi-MIndic for °tya; = Pali ap- paṭivattiya), <i>not to be turned back</i> (by any creature; said of the dharmacakra, once set in motion by a Buddha): Mv iii.327.7 (vs, no v.l.); in Mv i.330.4 (prose) doubtless [Page048-a+ 71] read so with 1 ms., the other pravartayaṃ, Senart em. apravartiyaṃ; in Mv i.331.4 Senart with mss. apravartiyaṃ, in 332.7 apravartitaṃ, which is read in the same formula SP 179.1 (prose, no v.l.); in Mv i.332.21 aparivartitaṃ, in 333.12 apravartiyaṃ, v.l. aparivartiya. In Pali ap- parently only appaṭi° occurs, and I believe this must have been the original reading. No being could <i>turn back</i> the wheel started by the Buddha. But evidently in BHS tradition this became confused with forms (ppp. as well as gdve.) of pra-, pari-vṛt-, which of course also yield a tolerable sense: <i>which had never been set in motion</i> or <i>could not be set in motion</i> by any (other) being. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=047">[047,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अप्रतिवर्णनीय.html">◀ aprativarṇanīya</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अप्रतिवाणि.html">aprativāṇi ▶</a></div></div>
