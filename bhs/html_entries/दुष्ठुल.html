<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>duṣṭhula</b>, adj. (also spelled <b>°ṣṭū°</b>; = Pali duṭṭhulla, adj. and n.; cf. <b>dauṣṭhulya</b>; on etym see below), <i>wicked,</i> <i>grievously evil</i>: °lām āpattim Prāt 504.1 (Chin. <i>une faute</i> <i>grave</i>); MSV iii.79.5 (see <b>atisārin</b>), duṣṭūlāpattiḥ, a-duṣṭu° Hoernle, MR 12.5 (in a Vinaya fragment), rendered <i>grave</i> <i>offense, not…</i>; in Mvy 8424 °lārocana, 8473 °la-prati- [Page268-a+ 71] cchādana, Mironov °lāprati°, <i>telling</i> and <i>(not) concealing</i> <i>what is wicked</i> (no neg. in Tib. and Chin.), the word could (but need not) be considered equal to dauṣṭhulya; °la- samudācārāḥ, <i>of wicked behavior</i>, MSV ii.200.17 (of the <b>ṣaḍvargika</b> monks). In Prāt 479.12 duṣṭhulayā vācā (cf. Pali Vin. iii.128.22) could be rendered <i>with lewd words</i> (making sexual advances to a woman), which acc. to Childers and PTSD is a special (tho not the exclusive) mg. of Pali duṭṭhulla; since no other BHS occurrence of this word or dauṣṭhulya suggests this mg., it seems more probable that the standard meaning, <i>gravely evil</i>, prevails here too. Derivation from Skt. Gr. duṣṭhu (pendant to Skt. suṣṭhu) has been plausibly suggested by Lévi, Sūtrāl. vi.2 note 3, and others. Prob. Pali -ulla shows the older form of the ending: on the Pkt. suffix -ulla cf. Pischel 595. Probably dauṣṭhulya was first constructed as a hyper- Skt. form from duṭṭhulla; it was restricted to substantive use, and duṣṭhula (which seems to have been much rarer) was a back-formation from it, as adj. Leumann, cited by Wogihara, Lex. 27 f., came fairly close to this suggestion as an alternative (his first proposal seems to me implau- sible). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=267">[267,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="दुष्ट.html">◀ duṣṭa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="दुष्पोषत.html">duṣpoṣata ▶</a></div></div>
