<div id="definition"><ul><li>1 <b>bodha</b>, m. (? = bodhi, normally f. in BHS as in Pali; but Pali records also bodha, m., and Skt. bodha is used not very differently), <b>(1) = bodhi</b>, <i>enlightenment</i>, in the technical Buddhist sense; so far as noted, seems limited in BHS to the forms bodhāya and (rarely, prob. only in Mv) bodhāye, which are usually interpretable as datives: bodhāye Mv i.47.16; 60.11 (so mss. indicate); ii.130.18 (in prec. line bodhāya, but v.l. °ye, in same phrase); Senart, whose note i.369 on i.3.2 discusses both the forms, calls bodhāye fem., but such datives are recorded from indisputably m.-nt. stems, § 8.45; more tempting to the fem. interpretation is the occasional, tho rare, occurrence of bodhāya (in vss) where dat. syntax seems hard to accept; so gen., to sarvi bodhāya (mss.) abhūṣi lābhinaḥ SP 49.14 (vs), repeated often in the sequel, as 50.2 etc.; in 50.12 and 51.4 bodhāya is confirmed by citations Śikṣ 92.13; 93.5; bodhāya…varṇam SP 10.6 (vs) = 12.16; loc., bodhāya sthāpitāḥ SP 306.3 (vs); it is possible that the fem. gender of bodhi (in Pali and BHS) has led to some forms suggesting a stem bodhā (oblique °āya, °āye), but bodhāya is usually dat., and occurs often in prose; KN ed. of SP often keeps it but as often emends to bodhīya, with utter inconsistency; dat. occurrences of bodhāya, SP (in mss.) 14.2; 33.1; 46.10; 47.13; 303.12; 334.11; LV 209.9 (prose); 284.8; Mv i.46.1; 63.2, 11; 97.2; 234.5; ii.130.13, 17; Suv 42.6; Śikṣ 5.18; KP 20.9; Gv 105.15 (prose); Bbh 13.19 (prose), etc.; (<b>2</b>) n. of a householder: Divy 167.2 ff.; he lived in Śiśumāragiri; cf. Pali Bodhi (DPPN), a prince whose capital was Suṃsumāragiri; but the two stories seem quite unrelated otherwise. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=402">[402,1]</a><li>[2 <b>bodha</b>, m.
