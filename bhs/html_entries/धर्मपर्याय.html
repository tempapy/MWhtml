<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>dharma-paryāya</b>, m. (Pali dhammapariyāya, not well defined PTSD), lit. <i>device, means of</i> (teaching) <i>the</i> <i>doctrine</i>, and so, secondarily, <i>religious discourse</i>. Cf. Pali (kathā) sapariyāyā and nippariyāyā (e.g. Vism. 473.16--17), <i>discourse involving indirect- devices</i> (not to be taken ab- solutely literally), <i>and discourse to be taken literally, without</i> <i>‘devices’</i>; cf. AbhidhK. LaV-P. ix. 247, note. This fits the regular BHS mg. of <b>paryāya</b>, q.v. 2. Tib. renders chos kyi (dharma-) rnam graṅs, <i>specification, enumeration</i> (Das); only in this cpd. the Tib. Dictt. allege also the mg. <i>treatise,</i> <i>dissertation</i> for rnam graṅs, but obviously that is made to fit this word alone; the Tib. rendering was intended to ren- der Skt. paryāya, <i>repetition, series</i>, etc. (only in the Veda does it mean <i>a piece of text</i>, and then chiefly if not exclusively one that is <i>repeated, a refrain</i>, etc.; this special use cannot be related to the BHS and Pali word, tho PTSD would have it so). Originally, the mg. was close to that of <b>upā-</b> <b>yakauśalya</b>, indeed it was a verbal manifestation of that quality as clearly in: tathāgatasyaiṣa kulaputrā dharma- paryāyo (so WT with most mss., supported by Tib. chos kyi rnam graṅs te; KN deśanā-paryāyo, which would be substantially equivalent) yad evaṃ vyāharati, nāsty atra tathāgatasya mṛṣāvādaḥ SP 320.5, <i>this is the Tathāgata's</i> <i>way of</i> (teaching the) <i>doctrine…</i> (sc. by giving out state- ments not literally true); <i>in so doing the T. does not lie</i>; cf. dharmāṇāṃ paryāya-jñānam Bbh 214.10 (with dhar- māṇāṃ lakṣaṇa-jñānam id.11); ayaṃ mañjuśrīḥ dharma- paryāyaḥ, asmiṃ sthāne pracariṣyati Mmk 657.3, <i>this, M.,</i> <i>is a way of</i> (teaching) <i>the doctrine</i> (does this refer to the following discourse?); (ātmanaḥ parinirvāṇaṃ vyāharati tathā tathā ca sattvān paritoṣayati) nānāvidhair dharma- paryāyaiḥ SP 318.1, here perhaps merely <i>by various ways</i> <i>of</i> (teaching) <i>the doctrine</i> (but possibly <i>religious disqui-</i> <i>sitions</i>); more commonly the word comes to be used of a specific <i>religious discourse</i>: asmin khalu dharmaparyāye [Page280-a+ 71] bhāṣyamāṇe Divy 340.8; Av i.50.12; 233.4; ii.108.3; ito °ryāyād SP 225.3; ayaṃ °ryāyo Mv ii.297.12; frequently named, buddhānusmṛtir nāma °ryāyo Mv i.163.11; applied to the work in which it occurs, Lalitavistaro nāma °ryāyaḥ LV 4.17; Karmavibhaṅgaṃ…°ryāyaṃ deśayiṣyāmi (mis- printed °yami) Karmav 29.31; other occurrences, °ryāyaḥ Mvy 6263; kiṃ (so! prob. kiṃ-nāmā, cpd.) nāmāyaṃ… °ryāyaḥ RP 59.20 (similarly in Pali, DN i.46.20--21, Ānanda asks, and is told, what is the name of this dham- mapariyāya, viz. the first sutta of DN); imaṃ °ryāyaṃ śrutvā Śikṣ 137.18; °ryāye KP 52.1. Once in SP 28.6 (vs), the simple <b>paryāya</b>, q.v., is used for dharma-p° in this sense. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=279">[279,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="धर्मपद्मश्रीकुशला.html">◀ dharmapadmaśrīkuśalā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="धर्मपाल.html">dharmapāla ▶</a></div></div>
