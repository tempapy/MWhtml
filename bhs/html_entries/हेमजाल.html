(195.5) dvihi hemajālehi praticchannā abhūṣi suvarṇa- mayena ca °lena rūpyamayena ca; the next sentence, both times, says that the golden hemajāla had bells of silver, the silver one bells of gold; Senart supposes that hema- has come to mean <i>precious substance</i> in general, but I know of nothing else to support this; on the other hand, in Mv ii.453.17 the lit. mg. may well apply, elephants being described as hemajāla-praticchanna (misprinted hemalāla° in text), as in Pali AN iv. 393.21 (°saṃchanna). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=621">[621,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="हेमक्रोड.html">◀ hemakroḍa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="हेमजालप्रतिच्छन्ना.html">hemajālapraticchannā ▶</a></div></div>
