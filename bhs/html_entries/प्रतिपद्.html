<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>pratipad</b>, f., also <b>°dā</b> (= Pali paṭipadā), <i>course of</i> <i>conduct, practice, behavior</i>, esp. <i>good, approved behavior</i>, = <b>pratipatti</b>, q.v.; acc. to Childers and PTSD, so also primarily Pali paṭipadā; this mg. is recognized by Speyer on Av ii.130.2, which he reads by em. araṇya-°daṃ samādāya (better, I think araṇāṃ pra°, see s.v. <b>araṇya</b>; in that case render <i>passionless way of behavior</i>); he also accepts this mg. in puṇyāṃ pratipadam udbhāvayan dānadamasaṃyamādibhiḥ Jm 100.10, <i>displaying meritorious</i> <i>behavior by…</i>; vākpragraheṇa pratipanmayena Jm 105.2, <i>by</i> (the kind of) <i>acceptance of his words which consists of</i> <i>behavior</i>, i.e. by not only assenting verbally but putting them into practice; (anayāpi…caryayānayāpi) pratipadā LV 263.11 (pratipad = caryā), and similarly 264.18; often rendered <i>way, path</i>, and called ‘a quasi-synonym of magga’ in PTSD; this is due to the fact that the <i>middle</i> <i>course of conduct</i>, madhyamā pratipad(ā), is (in BHS as in Pali) identified with the eight-fold way (mārga) stated in the fourth Noble Truth, but the terms are quite differ- ently defined, ma° pra° being the course of <i>behavior</i> which steers between the two extremes (anta) of violent asceticism and worldliness; the lack of real synonymity between Pali magga and paṭipadā is shown, e.g., by DN ii.154.25-26 (kaṅkhā vā vimati vā) Buddhe vā dhamme vā saṃghe vā magge vā paṭipadāya vā (obviously different things must be meant); madhyamayaiva pratipadā LV 416.21 (con- trasted with amadhyamā pratipad = violent asceticism, 416.19); here as elsewhere such a statement introduces the Four Noble Truths, the fourth of which is duḥkhaniro- dhagāminī pratipad (with or without āryasatyam, in LV 417.3, 12 without it, in 12 = eṣa evāryāṣṭāṅgamārgaḥ); so Mvy 1314, 1319, 1324; Mv ii.138.5 (with āryasatyam) and 10 (without it); 285.4 (without it); SP 179.3 (with it); more metaphysical interpretations of the term madhyamā pratipad in Bbh 39.26; KP 52.6 and repeatedly in following sections; one of the ten bala of a Tathāgata is sarvatragā- manī-pratipaj-jñānam Mvy 125, cf. sarvatragāminī-(the more usual form)-pratipatti-jñāna-balam Dharmas 76 (note obvious equivalence of pratipad and pratipatti!), <i>power of knowledge of courses of conduct which may lead to</i> <i>any result</i>; in same context sarvatragāminīṃ ca prati- padaṃ (v.l. °dāṃ) vetti Mv i.159.13 (vs), and, for another, see s.v. <b>pratipadā</b>; parānukampā-pratipad Jm 28.7, <i>conducting oneself with compassion for others</i>; nairyāṇika- (and °kī) pratipad, see s.v. <b>nairyāṇika</b>; śaikṣa-pratipady uttarikaraṇīyam (see this) Sukh 2.13, <i>in the course</i> (<i>practice</i>; here we could also, no doubt, translate <i>path</i>) of the <b>śaikṣa</b> (q.v.); there are four <i>courses of conduct</i> (Tib. lam, <i>way,</i> <i>path</i>, but also <i>manner of conduct</i>) Mvy 1244--1248, viz duḥkhā pra° dhandhābhijñā, sukhā pra° dhandhābhijñā, duḥkhā pra° kṣiprābhijñā, sukhā pra° kṣiprā° (for the corresponding Pali list, and interpretation, see Childers s.v. paṭipadā).
