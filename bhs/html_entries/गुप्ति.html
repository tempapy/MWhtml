<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>gupti</b>, f., in Mv nt. in form (n. sg. °tiṃ), in Mv sometimes written <b>gupta</b>, nt., seems to be false Sktization of the word which appears in Pali as kutti, apparently = Skt. kḷpti, <i>form, formation, fashion</i>: note esp. svara-gupti = Pali sara-kutti (Jāt. vi.293.19; Vin. ii.108.18, comm. 1202.6 = sara-kiriyā), <i>form</i> (timbre? so Lévi, JAs. 1915, I, 404 n.) <i>of voice</i>, Bbh 61.(18--)20 (yādṛśī teṣāṃ varṇa- puṣkalatā bhavati, tādṛśī tasya; yādṛśa āroha-pariṇāhaḥ, tādṛśas tasya bhavati;) yādṛśī svara-guptis teṣāṃ, tādṛśī tasya bhavati (Chin. acc. to Wogihara <i>sound</i>, i.e. perhaps <i>timbre, of words</i>); very similarly Divy 222.21 (Indra made Mūrdhāta like himself; there was no difference between them, na…nānākaraṇaṃ vā yad utāroha-)pariṇāho (so read with mss., as in Bbh; ed. em. °hau) varṇapuṣkalatā svara-guptyā svaragupter nānyatra…; see also s.v. <b>guptikā</b>; in Mv a dozen times in a cliché where gupti (sometimes written gupta) is parallel and synonymous with liṅga, dhvaja, and kalpa (sometimes ākalpa; cf. Jāt. vi.293.19 ākappaṃ sara-kuttiṃ vā na rañño sadisam ācare); with minor variants the cliché reads yaṃ (yat) kiṃci(d) gṛhi- (or ṛṣi-, parivrājaka-, tīrthika-)-liṅgaṃ gṛhi-(etc.)-guptiṃ (mss. sometimes guptaṃ, very rarely guptiḥ; Senart sometimes em. gupti) gṛhi-(etc.)-dhvajaṃ gṛhi-(etc.)-kalpaṃ (mss. sometimes ākalpaṃ) sarvaṃ (sam-)antar(a)hitaṃ (antarahāye), describing sudden and miraculous changes in heretics upon their conversion-- they suddenly appear like Buddhist monks: Mv ii.234.(3--) 4; iii.65.(3--)4; 92.(8--)9; 180.14; 181.5; 329.11; 379.14; 413.(11--)12; 423.8; 430.16; 432.2; here prob. belongs also ācāra-gupti-kuhaka(ḥ) śramaṇaḥ KP 121.3; 123.1, 8; ācāraguptiḥ kuhako 126.12; here Tib. renders literally, (hypocritical) <i>while guarding</i> (propriety of conduct); as KP 123 makes clear in detail, it refers to a monk who [Page213-b+ 71] goes thru all the external proper forms of behavior but for interested, selfish motives (hence kuhaka); 2d and 3d Chin. translations render ācāra-gupti by <i>(having) dignity</i> <i>of demeanor</i>, and prob. gupti really meant <i>external form</i>, as very clearly in Mv. See next but one, and cf. <b>gutti</b> (for Skt. gupti, in a different sense). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=213">[213,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="गुप्ता.html">◀ guptā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="गुप्तिक.html">guptika ▶</a></div></div>
