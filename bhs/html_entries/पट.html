<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>paṭa</b>, m. (rarely nt.), (<b>1</b>) <i>cloth</i>, as in Skt., seemingly in very general sense: in Mvy 5864, 9168 Tib. snam bu, which is said to mean <i>woolen cloth</i> (contrast paṭaka Mvy 9169); in SP 75.7 (prose) both Burnouf (who reads paṭṭa, see his note p. 369--370) and Kern translate <i>silk</i>; the word is cpd. with prec. <b>duṣya-</b> or <b>dūṣya-</b>, q.v.; B. and K. regard the cpd. as a dvandva, but it is surely a karmadh., meaning some kind of <i>fine cloth</i> (see <b>duṣya</b>); in Kv 81.6 f. (likewise in Mv ii.157.7) it also means <i>cloth</i> in general, as used to garb persons initiated in various religious orders, see s.v. <b>indra-paṭa; (2)</b> in Mv iii.31.11 apparently <i>piece,</i> <i>fragment</i> (of a stone; cf. Skt. paṭati, <i>splits</i>), if the text is right: (upalānāṃ) paṭaṃ (so mss., Senart paṭāṃ) chittvā, <i>splitting off a piece of the stones</i>; (<b>3</b>) in LV 315.15 (vs) assumed to be a kind of bird, but reading uncertain; Lefm. [Page316-a+ 71] vīkṣasva bodhimaṇḍe paṭukroñcāhaṃsakokilamayūrāḥ, with v.l. paṭa for paṭu; Calc. paṭa-; Tib. pa ta kun ta (presumably understanding it as n. of a single bird) for paṭa(or paṭu-)kroñca (the rest of the cpd. is correctly ren- dered in Tib.); neither paṭa nor paṭu seems to be known as a bird-name; if paṭu is right, could it not be taken as adv. with vīkṣasva ? <i>look keenly, sharply, at the…</i>; [(<b>4</b>) on LV 127.17 for paṭopachedana read vaṭṭopa°, supported by best ms. and Pali; see s.v. <b>vaṭṭa</b>.] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=315">[315,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="पञ्जल.html">◀ pañjala</a></div><div id="next"><a href="पटक.html">paṭaka ▶</a></div></div>
