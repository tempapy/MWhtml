<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>apakṣāla</b>, m., <i>fault, defect, failing, sin</i>: Bbh 351.17 (catvāraḥ) °lāḥ, te prahīṇā bhavanti (they are then listed; as a result of the riddance, the vihāra becomes supari- śuddha, line 21); 352.23 sarvāpakṣālāpagata-; cf. Wogi- hara, Lex. 17; in Mvy 7069 v.l. for Kyoto ed. <b>apakṣaṇa</b>, q.v. (Mironov reads apakṣālaḥ, with v.l. only avakṣayaḥ); [Page043-a+ 71] Tib. skyon, regularly = doṣa; Chin. <i>transgression, evil</i>; Jap. <i>evil, calamity</i>; Śikṣ 145.6 ata evodārakuśalapakṣa- vivarjanatā 'pakṣāla ity ucyate (Bendall and Rouse <i>throwing away</i>, but the above meaning would fit well; Tib. ma bsruṇs pa, could mean <i>non-observance</i>); but acc. to the Kyoto ed. of Mvy (above), Chinese versions of Śikṣ prove that its text had a form of -kṣaṇ- (which is said to be phonetically reproduced in the Chin.). Bendall and Rouse compare Pali khalayati, in Jāt. iv.205.13 (correct their ref.) khalayātha; comm. khalīkāraṃ pāpetvā niddhamatha. Cf. also Pali avakkhalita, <i>mistake, offense</i> (CPD), which is connected with Skt. skhal-. Is apakṣāla an unhistorical back-formation from a MIndic word related to this latter? Despite the alleged Chinese support for apakṣaṇa, it seems a questionable reading, and apak- ṣāla should prob. be read, with Mironov in Mvy (as well as in Śikṣ, for which no v.l. is recorded). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=042">[042,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अपक्षण.html">◀ apakṣaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अपक्ष्य.html">apakṣya ▶</a></div></div>
