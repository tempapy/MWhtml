<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>caryā</b> (Skt.) = <b>cari</b>, q.v., used like that form (regu- larly in prose, but also in verses) esp. of the <i>course of</i> <i>conduct</i> of Bodhisattvas, which has four aspects or stages: catvārīmāni bodhisattvānāṃ bodhisattvacaryāṇi Mv i.1.2, listed in 3 as prakṛti-caryā, praṇidhāna-c°, <b>anuloma-c°</b>, anivartana-c° (cf. Senart i p. xxi); same list, called cata- sraḥ…bodhisattvacaryāḥ i.46.6; they are discussed in the following 46.8 ff. (prakṛti-c° 46.8--47.11; praṇidhi-c° 47.12--63.10; anuloma- and avivarta-c°, very briefly, 63.11--14); they seem to be aspects, or possibly successive stages, of the Bodhisattva's long course of development; prakṛti- refers to his original, basic endowment; praṇi- dhāna- (°dhi-) to his vows to attain enlightenment; anuloma- (also ānulomikī, see s.v. ānulomika) alludes to his progressive approach to the goal, and anivartana- (avivarta-) refers to the point at which it becomes im- possible for him to backslide. We also find bodhicaryā(ṇi, with nt. ending, as above) Mv i.252.4, °ryāṃ ii.341.1 (both of these vss), and duṣkara-caryāṃ ii.241.4 (prose), parallel to bodhi-cari and duṣkara-cari.See further <b>artha-</b> <b>caryā, dharma-caryā</b>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=226">[226,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="चर्मचटक.html">◀ carmacaṭaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="चर्याकारा.html">caryākārā ▶</a></div></div>
