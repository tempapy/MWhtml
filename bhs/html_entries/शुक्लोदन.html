<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Śuklodana</b> (Pali Sukko°), n. of a brother of Śuddho- dana: Mv i.352.13; 355.19; iii.176.14 (father of Ānanda, Upadhāna, and Devadatta); Mvy 3600. In Mv iii.177.1, acc. to mss., another Śuklodana, also brother of Śuddho- dana, is named (just after iii.176.14 above), as the father of Nandana and Nandika (v.l. Nandaka); Senart em. to Śukrodana, referring to Kern, Der Buddhismus 310, who alleges among Śuddhodana's brothers, besides Śuklodana, also ‘Śukrodana or Śuklodana’. The source of Kern's statement is not clear to me; it would have to be a northern (Skt. or BHS) text; both forms would be Sukkodana in MIndic. In any case I think that Mv iii.177.1 has carelessly substituted a repetition of Śuklo° for Dhautodana of i.352.13 and 355.20 (or Droṇodana of Mvy 3601), the correct name of the fourth of the brothers, otherwise missing in this passage. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=530">[530,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शुक्ला.html">◀ śuklā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शुङ्गीभूत.html">śuṅgībhūta ▶</a></div></div>
