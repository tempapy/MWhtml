<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>dharma-kāya</b>, m. (in Pali recorded only as Bhvr. adj. in quite different sense, <i>having a body that is, or is</i> <i>characterized by, the Doctrine</i>, DN iii.84.24, said of the Buddha; see below for similar use in BHS); (<b>1</b>) <i>the mass</i> <i>of conditions of existence</i>, see s.v. <b>kāya</b> (2); (<b>2</b>) perhaps to be rendered <i>spiritual body (?)</i>, contrasted with <b>rūpa-</b> <b>kāya</b>, q.v.: (dṛṣṭo mayopādhyāyānubhāvena) sa bhagavān dharmakāyena (<i>in his spiritual form</i>, or the like; he had not seen him physically) no tu rūpakāyena (<i>but not in his</i> <i>physical form</i>) Divy 19.11; similarly 360.19 (…na dṛṣṭo rūpakāyo me 20--21); na rūpakāyatas tathāgataḥ prajñā- tavyaḥ…dharmakāyaprabhāvitāś ca buddhā bhagavanto na rūpakāya-prabhāvitāḥ Samādh 22.7 (Régamey, <i>Absolute</i> <i>Body, Material Body</i>; R. does not understand prabhāvita quite rightly; it means <i>recognized</i>, see BR s.v. bhū with pra, caus., 3); similarly 22.9 and esp. 34, with the explana- tion, dharmeṇa kāyu nirjito, (His) <i>body is born</i> (? see <b>nirjita</b>) <i>by dharma</i>; see Régamey p. 23; elsewhere, with the same contrast, the word dharma-k° is used as a Bhvr. adj. (cf. the Pali usage above, with which this usage may be directly connected), na hi tathāgato rūpakāyato draṣṭavyaḥ, dharmakāyās tathāgatāḥ AsP 513.15; instead of rūpakāya, simply kāya may be used in contrast, dharma- kāyā buddhā bhagavantaḥ, mā khalu punar imaṃ bhik- ṣavaḥ satkāyaṃ kāyaṃ manyadhvaṃ, dharmakāya- pariniṣpattito māṃ bhikṣavo drakṣyanty AsP 94.11--13; (<b>3</b>) perhaps to be rendered in the same way as (2), but considered the highest of three <i>bodies</i> of a Buddha, the [Page277-b+ 71] others being <b>saṃbhoga-</b> and <b>nirmāṇa-k°</b>; this is a late formula (Régamey, l.c. above) and I have noted the triad only in Mvy 116--118 among texts included in this work (see under the others); (<b>4</b>) without specific contrast with other kāyas but most likely belonging to (2) rather than (3): sa dharmakāya-prabhāvito (see Samādh 22.7 above) darśanenāpi sattvānām arthaṃ karoti Śikṣ. 159.7; manomaya-dharmakāyasya tathāgatasya Laṅk 192.1 (AbhidhK. knows a manomaya-kāya, app. not identified with dharma-k°, see LaV-P. Index; acc. to ii.209 it pertains to the rūpa-dhātu); prob., na rājan kṛpaṇo loke dharma- kāyena saṃspṛśet Divy 560.2 (vs). [In LV 401.21 all mss. and Calc. read Dharmakāya as n. of one of the four devatās of the bodhi-tree; Lefm. <b>Dharmakāma</b>, with Tib. chos ḥdod; the em. seems plausible.] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=277">[277,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="धर्मकाम.html">◀ dharmakāma</a></div><div id="next"><a href="धर्मकीर्ति.html">dharmakīrti ▶</a></div></div>
