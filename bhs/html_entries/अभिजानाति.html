<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>abhijānāti</b> (= Pali id.), (<b>1</b>) <i>knows by</i> <b>abhijñā</b>, q.v. The technical Buddhist meaning of the noun is certainly at times associated with the verb, which in Skt. means <i>knows</i> in a very general way. The extent to which the spe- cial Buddhist sense is present in the verb is often doubtful; I list a few cases where it seems pretty clear: abhijānāmi SP 200.8 (Burnouf and Kern, <i>remember</i>, I think wrongly); Mv i.57.7, 12; Gv 446.14; Vaj 34.20. The translation <i>remember</i>, also given CPD, is due to the fact that events of the past are often referred to; but I think the Buddha (the usual subject in such cases) <i>knows</i> them by <i>super-</i> <i>natural knowledge</i> or so-called <i>intuition</i> (<b>abhijñā</b>, q.v.), not by <i>memory</i>; (<b>2</b>) <i>recognizes</i> (as a duty), <i>takes upon</i> <i>oneself</i> (a vow or undertaking); so also in Pali, e.g. MN i.80.5 (definitions in Pali dictionaries including CPD hardly do justice to this mg.): LV 254.2 abhijānāmy ahaṃ…ekam evādvitīyaṃ kolam āhāram āhartum, <i>I</i> <i>undertake to allow myself to eat only a single kola as food</i>; similarly LV 255.8, 15. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=050">[050,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अभिछादयति.html">◀ abhichādayati</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अभिजि.html">abhiji ▶</a></div></div>
