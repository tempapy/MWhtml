<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>tīrthika</b> (also <b>para-t°</b>; see prec. and next items; prob. Sktized from MIndic (Pali) titthiya, see <b>tīrthya</b>; both are very common in prose as well as vss), (<b>1</b>) <i>heretic</i>; like its relatives, pejoratively used; there is one seeming exception, tīrthikā vā bhavanti bhavasūdanāḥ Mv i.106.8 (vs), where if the text is correct it seems to be said of Bodhisattvas in the 8th bhūmi that they <i>become religious</i> <i>prophets</i> (or the like), <i>destroying</i> (the states of normal) <i>existence</i>. I suspect a corruption, and cannot explain the text as it stands any more than Senart (his doubtful suggestion based on LV Calc. 313.19 falls now with the reading of that text, which in Lefm. 250.1 is replaced by…tīrthyāḥ, <i>heretics</i>, kurvante). However, it is barely possible that this one Mv passage preserves the original neutral mg., <i>adherent</i> (or <i>founder</i>) <i>of</i> (any) <i>religion</i>. A trace of this may also remain in the not infrequent pre- fixation of anya- to t°, <i>other</i> (than Buddhist) <i>sectarian</i>, LV 268.12; Mv iii.49.12 (anyatīrthikapūrvo, <i>formerly a</i> <i>member of another sect</i>); 412.7; or <b>para-t°</b>, q.v.; cf. kutīr- thikā(ḥ) LV 12.10, <i>members of base</i> (heretical) <i>sects</i>. Other- wise, and very often, tīrthika alone means <i>heretic</i> simply: SP 272.10; LV 250.21; 258.1; 260.9; Mv i.45.10; 69.17; ii.135.12; iii.392.7 (śramaṇa-brāhmaṇa-tīrthika-gaṇikā, apparently implying that brahmans were not included among tīrthikas; this cpd. appears in some of the other passages listed); Mvy 3514; Divy 146.19; 152.5; 275.9; Av i.2.6; 16.3 etc., common; Bhad 52; Bbh 173.11 etc.; [Page255-a+ 71] yat kiṃcit tīrthikaliṅgaṃ…LV 409.17; Mv iii.329.11, <i>whatever</i> (external) <i>mark</i> (dress etc.) <i>of heretics</i> (was borne by converts, all magically disappeared and they wore the aspect of Buddhist monks); tīrthikāvakrāntaka, see <b>avakrāntaka; (2)</b> n. of a nāga: Mvy 3320; (<b>3</b>) see s.v. <b>sama-tīrthika</b>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=254">[254,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="तीर्थकर.html">◀ tīrthakara</a></div><div id="next"><a href="तीर्थिकर.html">tīrthikara ▶</a></div></div>
