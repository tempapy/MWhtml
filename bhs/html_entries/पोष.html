<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>poṣa</b>, m. (= Pali posa, which is said by PTSD and Geiger 30.3 to be used only in vss; doubtless somehow derived from Skt. puruṣa, but Geiger's theory is not compelling), <i>person, individuality, soul, spirit</i>; occurs often in prose of various texts, regularly associated with near- synonyms like jīva, jantu, pudgala (puṃgala), and even with puruṣa itself, which clearly had come to be felt as a different word (if it was derived from the same original): in Mvy 4672 defined by Tib. gso ba, <i>nourishment</i>, as if from root puṣ-, tho the context proves it means the same as puruṣa, which is the next word; puruṣa also adjoins it (along with other words of like mg.) in Śikṣ 236.15; Laṅk 63.15, et alibi; ŚsP 120.12 (puruṣa in parallel phrase 13), et alibi; otherwise with similar words, Śikṣ 199.8; KP 125.6; 142.8 (in these two miswritten pauṣa); Dbh 39.21; MSV ii.76.15; <b>niṣpoṣa</b>, <i>without personality</i>, along with nirjīva, niṣpudgala, etc., KP 97.2; Dbh 43.13; Vaj 38.5. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=355">[355,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="पोम.html">◀ poma</a></div><div id="next"><a href="पोषध.html">poṣadha ▶</a></div></div>
