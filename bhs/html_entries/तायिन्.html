<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>tāyin</b>, m. (= AMg. tāi, defined as <i>attaining salvation</i>, i.e. <i>holy, religious</i>; also <i>who protects himself and others</i>, i.e. a Jina; Pali tādi, see below), originally Prakritic for Pali tādi(n) = Skt. tādṛś; see <b>tādṛ(n), tādṛśa(ka)</b>. The identity of the two words can hardly be questioned. The [Page252-a+ 71] mg. of Pali tādi(n) is also quite clear, <i>such</i> (= tādṛś); doubt remains only as to whether this meant originally <i>such as the Buddha</i>, of the same quality as He, or <i>such</i> <i>as a religious man ought to be</i>, thus <i>holy, following the path</i> <i>of true religion</i>. On the Pali see esp. Childers s.v., also Senart on Mv ii.256.9, where BHS uses evaṃrūpa in nearly the same sense; Senart points out that tathārūpa glosses tādi in Dhp. comm. Acc. to Childers tādi is usually applied to <i>holy men</i>, only rarely to Buddha. In BHS tāyin most often applies to Buddhas, but also fairly often to Bodhisattvas, and occasionally to other holy men. Once, at least, <b>tādṛśaka</b>, q.v., is clearly applied to a Buddha, like tāyin. These facts all together make it seem clear to me that the etym. and original mg. are as stated above. It is true that Tib. (see on Mvy below) interprets tāyin as if for trāyin, rendering <i>protector</i> or the like; some modern scholars (Burnouf, Lotus 16, on vs 73 of Chap. 1; pw 7.345 ‘wohl nur fehlerhaft für trāyin’) assume that this was the etym. and primary mg. of tāyin. But against this stands not only Pali but BHS <b>tādṛśa(ka), tādṛ(n)-</b>. Tib. doubtless has a secondary popular etymology. The forms are typical of in-stems: tāyī n. sg. (SP 45.13; Mvy 15, 1746), tāyinaḥ gen. sg. (SP 69.2; 208.7, etc.), °nām gen. pl. (SP 176.8 etc.), tāyibhiḥ (LV 388.13), etc. Occasionally the mss. write corruptly tāpin (so Mv ii.349.12 text, prob. mere misprint; Mmk 98.8; 499.19; 599.20; 600.17). (<b>1</b>) Used of others than Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, <i>holy</i>: anigho tāyi tam āhu śrotriyaṃ ti Mv iii.400.2; ariyo (mss., Senart āryo) tāyi pravuccati tathatvā 400.6; in iii.397.2 read, śramaṇo tāyi (mss. bhāvayi, Senart tādi, cf. 400.6) pravuccati tathatvā, <i>he is called in truth a monk, a holy man</i> (or, <i>one such as the Buddha</i>, or, <i>such as he should be</i>); tāyī sa sarvāṃ (read °vaṃ) prajahāti duḥkham Ud xix.1, in later version of line which in oldest ms. reads prahāsate (= °syate) sarvabhavāni tādṛśāḥ, <i>the holy man (men) gets</i> <i>(will get) rid of all misery (states of being)</i>; (<b>2</b>) used of Bodhisattvas (other than Śākyamuni in his last existence, when in laudations he is often given epithets of a Bud- dha, even before his enlightenment): SP 304.5 (vs; bud- dhaputrasya tāyinaḥ), 12; 306.1; Mv ii.370.1 (vs, buddha- putrāṇa tāyināṃ); Sādh 93.10 (of Mañjuvajra = Mañjuśrī); Dbh 29(55). 14 (?reference not clear); (<b>3</b>) but most com- monly of the Buddha (Śākyamuni) or of any or all Buddhas: Mvy 15 (text trāyī, tāyī, but Mironov tāyī without v.l.; Tib. skyob pa, <i>protector</i>); 1746 (tāyī; Tib. skyob ston, <i>protector-teacher</i>); SP 25.1; 45.13; 69.2; 116.9 (tāyinaḥ, <i>for the Buddha</i>; wrongly Kern); 176.8; 208.7; 303.13; 331.8; LV 122.20 (tāyino with v.l. for kāyi no); 388.13; 421.5; Mv ii.349.12 = iii.273.11; ii.351.8, 14; 352.15; 353.17; iii.109.20; 124.20; 445.17; Av ii.199.4; Suv 17.11; Śikṣ 260.11; Mmk 98.8; 125.15; 320.14; 375.10, 15; 442.9; 499.19; 599.20; 600.17; nikṣiptaḥ sādhu tāyinā Divy 712.7. All these passages (except Mvy where the word is cited alone) are verses; they are not exhaustive, but it is doubtful whether tāyin occurs anywhere in prose. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=251">[251,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="तायण.html">◀ tāyaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="तारक.html">tāraka ▶</a></div></div>
