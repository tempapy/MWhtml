<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>praṇidhāna</b>, nt. (m. modifiers Bhad 58; = Pali paṇidhāna; like <b>praṇidhi</b>, n. act. to <b>praṇidadhāti,</b> <b>praṇidheti</b>), <i>fixation</i> of mind (ceto-pra° Mv i.239.5; iii.138.19; Pali ceto-paṇidhi), and so <i>ardent desire, earnest</i> <i>wish, vow</i>; sometimes (but rarely) of purely worldly desires, which are reprobated, praṇidhāna-vivarjitam SP 142.8 (vs); usually religious at least in basis, fulfilment being expected on the ground of acts of merit, which are often mentioned in a solemn declaration of wish; the thing desired may nevertheless be worldly (wealth, or special marks of grace), tho often the intention is stated to use it for religious-purposes: Mv i.302.19 (magic possession of garlands); iii.414.12 (fortunate rebirths); Divy 23.17; 65.10 (to become a cakravartin); or it may be truly religious, yet not Buddhahood or Bodhisattvahood, SP 242.4 (here made by a past Buddha, to do services to Buddhas to come); most commonly to win enlightenment, i.e. to become a Buddha, SP 43.12; LV 31.22 (°na-paripūryai, so with mss.; cf. <b>praṇidhi-</b>paripūriye); 180.1; 415.15; Mv i.39.8; 104.3; 239.5; iii.138.19; Divy 66.22; 90.3; Av i.8.12; praṇidhāna-caryā, <i>a whole course of praṇidhānas</i>, Mv i.1.3, see s.v. <b>caryā</b>; when made by a Bodhisattva it may mean rather the vow to follow the Bodhisattva-course, and may then be called specifically caryā-pra° SP 64.13, 14, or bhadracarī-pra° Bhad 2, etc.; praṇidhāna is one of the ten bala of a Bodhisattva, Mvy 764, and one of his vaśitā, Mvy 778; anuloma-pra° Mv i.1.11, <i>continued successive pra°</i>, seems to mean a pra° repeated by the same individual (Śākyamuni in previous incarnations as cakravartin), in similar terms, as described later in i.48.17 ff.; there are ten mahāpraṇidhāna of a Bodhisattva, Dbh 14.15 ff., described at length (ten such are referred to in Sūtrāl. iv. 12, but the list quoted from another source by Lévi, note to Transl., is quite different from the Dbh list); four pūrva-praṇidhāna-padāni LV 204.16, each described in the sequel in an entire paragraph; three kinds of pra° Dharmas 112, viz. susthāna-prābandhikam (see <b>prāban-</b> <b>dhika</b>), sattvārtha-prābandhikam, buddhakṣetra-pariśo- dhakam. Rarely <b>prārthanā</b>, q.v., appears to be used of the <i>‘earnest wish’</i> for enlightenment. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=360">[360,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="प्रणिदधाति.html">◀ praṇidadhāti</a></div><div id="next"><a href="प्रणिधानसागरप्रभासश्री.html">praṇidhānasāgaraprabhāsaśrī ▶</a></div></div>
