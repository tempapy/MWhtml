<div id="definition"><ul><li>1 <b>sakhila</b>, adj. (= Pali id.; cf. <b>sākhilya</b> and 1 <b>akhila</b>), <i>soft, smooth</i>, once of (a garment of) cloth: sakhilā khu-d- ayaṃ…karpāsānāṃ paṭapilotikasaṃghāṭī, mṛdukā-d- ayaṃ…(same words), masinā-d-ayaṃ…, sukhumā-d- ayaṃ…, tanukā-d-ayaṃ…, etc., Mv iii.53.17; this proves that the usual interpretation, <i>friendly</i>, cannot be right; it is of course based on the assumption of derivation from sakhi, but this is proved wrong by the Mv passage; other- wise recorded in Pali and BHS only of speech, esp. the Buddha's; in Pali regularly assoc. with saṇha = ślakṣṇa and mudu = mṛdu; sakhilo glossed muduvacano DN comm. i.287.3 ff., and all comms. agree essentially on this, as well as on sākhalya, sākhalla (= <b>sākhilya</b>), which is the opposite of pharusa(-vācā etc.), e.g. Dhs. 1343; DN comm. iii.981.15--22; sākhallena Jāt. iv.57.5, glossed maṭṭhavacanena (note that maṭṭha is also applied to fine cloth, -sāṭaka Vism. 284.13); the mg. therefore is <i>smooth</i>, and of speech <i>suave, mild, gentle</i>: Buddhasya sakhilā girā Mv i.314.12 (vs), repeated below; su-sakhila-ślakṣṇa-vākyo ii.395.5; sakhilā Mvy 495, in list of epithets of Buddha's speech, = Tib. chub pa (? acc. to Das <i>accomplished,</i> <i>perfected</i>; Chin. seems to mean <i>affecting the hearts of all</i> <i>creatures</i>); of other (pious) persons, sūrataḥ (mss. su°) sakhilo mṛduḥ Mv ii.371.8 (vs); su-sakhila-vācā iii.280.19 (vs, by em.); saṃmodako sakhilo ślakṣṇavāco (mss. °cā) iii.372.4 (vs). The etym. of the word is obscure; BHS <b>akhila</b> = paruṣa, <i>harsh</i> (of speech), suggests interpretation as sa-khila, but may of course be a case of popular etym.; no meaning of khila is known which would seem to fit. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=544">[544,2]</a><li>2 <b>sa-khila</b>, <i>afflicted with hardness of heart</i> (<b>khila</b>, q.v.): RP 35.12 (vs; see <b>kiṃcana</b>). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=544">[544,2]</a></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="सखिका.html">◀ sakhikā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="सखुरप्रवार.html">sakhurapravāra ▶</a></div></div>
