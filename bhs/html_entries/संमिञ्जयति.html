<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>saṃmiñjayati</b> (= Pali °jeti, also written samiñjeṭi; connected with <b>un-minj-, ni-miñj-</b>, and prec. and next; in mss. and edd. also written samiñj-, but incorrectly, see below), <i>bends back, draws in, contracts</i>, parts of the body, esp. the arms; always assoc. with its opposite prasārayati (Skt.), <i>extends</i>: saṃmiñjitaṃ (vā) bāhuṃ (in Mv oftener °tāṃ…bāhāṃ) prasāraye(t, once °yeya) prasāritaṃ (vā, or ca) bāhuṃ (the noun may be omitted; Mv oftener °tāṃ…bāhāṃ) saṃmiñjaye(t) Mv i.55.1, 14; 56.8; iii.425.15, 22; 450.16; Mmk 3.26; Divy 473.6; Wald- schmidt, Kl. Skt. Texte 4, 65.20 (Śakrapraśnasūtra, acc. to p.5, ms. saṃmiñcita, but text prints saṃmiñj°); 157.18 (Mahāsamāj.); (yato care yato tiṣṭhe yato āse yato śaye, so Senart em.,) yato saṃmiñjaye kāyaṃ yato kāyaṃ prasāraye Mv iii.422.(16--)17 (so Senart, em., but prob. rightly), in a description of a bhikṣu, <i>whenever he draws</i> <i>in or extends</i> (any member of) <i>his body</i>. Leumann, Album Kern 393 f., adopts an earlier suggestion of Kern's and derives from sam-vṛj-. He rightly distinguishes this verb from Pali sam-iñjati (Dhp. 81, na samiñjanti paṇḍitā), <i>is moved, is perturbed</i>; cf. BHS <b>iñjate</b>. But when Leumann states that this sam-iñjati, in its Pali mg., is also found in BHS, I fear that he was speaking carelessly. The only cases of sam-iñj- which I have noted are shown by associa- tion with forms of prasār- to be false readings for saṃmiñj-; such cases also occur in Pali (PTSD). The only ‘confusion’ shown by BHS in this sept consists in the erroneous writing of samiñj- for saṃmiñj- (which Leumann also recognizes). Leumann's etym. seems to me at least more plausible than any other, including that of Lüders (s.v. <b>samarjana</b>). That double mm (or ṃm), not single m, is the only correct form is proved by un-miñj- and ni- miñj-, neither of which occurs in Pali; Leumann considers them (as he must according to his etymology) secondarily abstracted from saṃ-miñj-. I have found no trace of the sept elsewhere. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=581">[581,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="संमिञ्जन.html">◀ saṃmiñjana</a></div><div id="next"><a href="संमिञ्जित.html">saṃmiñjita ▶</a></div></div>
