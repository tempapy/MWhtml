<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>aṅga, (1)</b> <i>member, part</i> (as in Skt. and Pali, where it is recorded as nt. only), m. (at least modified by two m. adj.), sarve bhavāṅga…niruddhāḥ LV 420.14 (so all mss., Lefm. °dhā); (<b>2</b>) <i>attribute, quality, characteristic</i>, like the Skt. guṇa (so Pali, CPD s.v., 4, where it is shown that Pali uses it ‘mostly with numbers’, and often in dependence on samannāgata, cf. below); the 60 <i>qualities</i> (aṅga) of the Buddha's voice, Mvy 444, listed 445--504, cf. Sūtrāl. xii.9; same mg. in cpds., see <b>aṣṭāṅga</b> (2), <b>āprāṇyāṅga, svarāṅ-</b> <b>ga</b>; also kulaṃ (the family in which the Bodhisattva is born in his last existence) ṣaṣṭīhi aṅgehi samanvāgataṃ bhavati Mv i.197.14 (there follows a list of the 60 ‘qualities’). In the LV parallel, 23.10 ff., catuḥṣaṣṭy-ākārair…saṃ- pannakulaṃ bhavati.Repetition Mv ii.1.6, also with list following. Both Pali and BHS further refer to five <i>bad</i> <i>qualities</i> as pañcāṅga (Pali °aṅga): pañcāṅga-viprahīṇa (124.15 -vipratihīna), of Buddhas, Divy 95.17; 124.15; 264.30; acc. to Vism. 146.5--6 they are the nīvaraṇāni. On the other hand, there are five <i>good qualities</i> referred to by Pali pañcaṅga in Vism. 146.25 ff.; and a different set, characteristic of kings or brahmans, <i>‘gentlemanly qualities’</i>, PTSD s.v.; cf. s.v. <b>pañcāṅgika</b>, esp. 3; the Buddha speaks pañcāṅgena svareṇa, MSV i.220.20. The line between meanings 1 and 2 is not always easy to draw. E.g. Mvy 424 describes the Tathāgata as ṣaḍaṅgasamanvāgataḥ, re- ferring to the six aṅgas (<i>‘qualities’?</i> or <i>members, parts?</i>) of <b>upekṣā</b>, cf. chaḷaṅgasamannāgata DN iii.269.19 (list follows; consists of indifference to the objects of each of six senses), and Vism. 160.9 ff. (chaḷaṅgupekkhā is the first of ten upekkhā). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=005">[005,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अङ्कुशग्रह.html">◀ aṅkuśagraha</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अङ्गण.html">aṅgaṇa ▶</a></div></div>
