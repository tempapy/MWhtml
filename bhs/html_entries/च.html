<div id="definition"><ul><li>(<b>ca</b>, as in normal Skt. (BR; Speyer, Skt. Synt. § 441b, VSS § 282), is used (<b>1</b>) in sentences where a contrast seems implied, = tu, <i>but</i>: te caivaṃ vācaṃ bhāṣeran, tac ca bhaiṣajyam upanāmitaṃ na pibeyuḥ SP 321.10--11, <i>on the one hand</i> (ca) <i>they would speak thus, and yet</i> (ca; <i>on the other hand</i>) <i>they would not drink the proffered remedy</i>; (<b>2</b>) in the protasis of conditions, = yadi (acc. to Speyer, [Page220-1b+ 7] VSS l.c., ‘in Vedic and older Skt.,’ but this is too limited): deśayeyaṃ cāhaṃ dharmaṃ na vā deśayeyam LV 400.7, <i>whether I preach the dharma or not</i>--(the same result, as regards some people, will ensue); śakraś ca (mss., Senart em. ce) me varaṃ dadyāt Mv iii.6.15, <i>if Śakra</i> <i>should give me a boon</i>--. (<b>3</b>) Acc. to Senart, MV i notes pp. 370, 501, 561, ca may introduce a following word, [Page221-a+ 71] as ‘proclitic’, no longer enclitic; he says the same is authorized for Pali by the Mukhamattadīpanī, a comm. on Kaccāyana. Alleged cases are cited in Mv i.3.11; 57.10; 83.17 (? read 16?); 158.1; 241.13. In some of these (e.g. 158.1) ca seems to me quite normal; in others the position may be peculiar, as sometimes it is in Pali, see Childers s.v., but I do not believe it ever introduces a following word or phrase; some of the passages cited are violently emended by Senart in other respects. The Pali Dictt. do not recognize the usage alleged by Senart, and I am not convinced that it occurs in BHS.) <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=220">[220,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="घोषेश्वर.html">◀ ghoṣeśvara</a></div><div id="next"><a href="चकटि.html">cakaṭi ▶</a></div></div>
