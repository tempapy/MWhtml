<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>kṣepayati, (1)</b> <i>spends, passes</i> (time, with acc. kālam or some expression of time), is found in Skt. (BR 5.1349), and the simple kṣipati is commoner in that sense (ibidem). It is strange that Senart, Mv i.n. 492, PTSD on khepeti (s.v. khipati), and others have overlooked that fact, re- garded the usage as specifically Pali-BHS, and assumed confusion with kṣi, <i>destroy</i>. I have, to be sure, found no record of kṣepayati used absolutely in this sense in Skt., as it is in LV 276.11 (vs) brahmaśakrabhavane nityaṃ sukhaṃ kṣepituṃ, <i>to spend</i> (time) <i>happily forever in the</i> <i>home of B. and Ś</i>. (<b>2</b>) <i>exhausts, brings to an end, obliterates</i>; here influence of kṣi, <i>destroy</i>, might more reasonably be suspected, yet Skt. kṣip is sometimes used in nearly or quite the same sense, BR s.v. kṣip 7 (2.549; but as BR suspected, Mbh. Calc. 3.1094 should be read kṣīyeran, not kṣiperan, see Crit. ed. 3.30.30); it prob. is an extension of the meaning <i>spend</i> (time). So Divy 367.8 (narakaved- anīyāni karmāṇi) kṣepayitvā, <i>having spent (exhausted)</i> <i>their deeds that had to be suffered-for in hells</i>, which may illustrate the transition from <i>spend</i> (time) to <i>exhaust</i>; the change is complete in LV 237.13 (vs) saptarātra bhaṇamānu…sā viyūha na pi śakya kṣepituṃ, <i>tho</i> <i>described for a week, this splendor could not be exhausted</i> <i>(‘spent’)</i>. But it is doubtful whether any of these uses are strictly non-Skt. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=201">[201,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="क्षेपण.html">◀ kṣepaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="क्षेपु.html">kṣepu ▶</a></div></div>
