(BR s.v. 2), but used in BHS, as in Pali dhamma, very commonly and in a way which seems specially pointed and deserving of special [Page276-b+ 71] mention: asti-dharma, see s.v. 1 <b>asti</b>; vināśa-dharmeṇa (<i>subject to destruction, perishable</i>) mānsena Mv i.94.12; divyāś ca kāyāḥ parihāṇa- (v.l. °ṇi-) dharmāḥ SP 162.3 (vs), <i>and divine bodies were characterized by diminution</i>, i.e. became few (meaning proved by parallel 170.2; wrongly Burnouf and Kern); māreṇa…īrṣyādharmaparītena LV 267.2 (prose), <i>full of the quality of jealousy</i>; catvāra ime… duḥkhavipākā dharmāḥ RP 19.16 (prose), <i>qualities that</i> <i>result in misery</i>, i.e. vices; in Mv iii.200.5 are mentioned eight āścaryādbhuta dharma, <i>marvelous qualities</i>, of the Buddha, seven of which (the eighth apparently being omitted by mistake) are listed 200.6--202.2; they cor- respond imperfectly to the eight yathābhucca vaṇṇa of Pali DN ii.222.7, listed 222.13--224.14 (DN nos. 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 = Mv nos. 2, 7, 3, 4, 6); śuddhāvāsā ca devā aṣṭādaśa āmodanīyāṃ dharmān (<i>the eighteen ‘qualities of</i> <i>rejoicing’</i>, here <i>conditions of, elements</i> or <i>matters for re-</i> <i>joicing</i>) pratilabhanti Mv ii.259.10 (they are listed in the sequel); (<b>2</b>) like Pali dhamma, dharma (or dharmāyatana) is the object of manas (as rūpa of cakṣus, etc.); sometimes rendered <i>idea</i>; it seems likely that, at least in origin, it meant <i>quality, characteristic</i> (= 1), as that element in the outside world which the indriya manas (as distinguished from the five external organs of perception) concerned itself with; see AbhidhK. LaV-P. i.45, where it is ex- plained that ‘tho all the āyatanas are dharmas’ (<i>qualities</i>), ‘because it includes many and the chief (agra) dharma, one āyatana is specifically so called;’ in any case this exclusively Buddhist use occurs: dharmāyatanam Mvy 2039; Dharmas 24; dharmadhātuḥ Mvy 2057 (after mano- dhātuḥ, as dharmāyatanam 2039 follows mana-āy°); manendriyaṃ dharmavicāraṇeṣu Suv 56.12; similarly 57.8, etc.; see also dharmāyatanika, s.v. <b>āyatanika; (3)</b> in Laṅk used in a peculiar sense; pañcadharmāḥ Laṅk 229.6; °rma- id. 2.2; the list of them is given id. 228.5 pañca- dharmo (v.l. °mā, which seems surely correct), nimittaṃ nāma vikalpas tathatā samyagjñānaṃ ca, which are then defined in the sequel, but I confess I find the definitions hard to understand; Suzuki, Studies 155 ff., discusses the passage and renders dharma by <i>category</i>; it seems likely that it started out as a specialized application of mg. (1), <i>quality</i>; (<b>4</b>) very commonly, as with Pali dhamma, <i>state</i> <i>of existence, condition of being</i>; crystallized in the phrase or cpd. dṛṣṭa dharma, <i>the present state, the present life</i>, see <b>dṛṣṭa-dharma</b>; (nāhaṃ…ye) dharmā anityās te nityato deśayāmi, nāpi ye dharmā nityā te anityato deśayāmi Mv i.173.2, <i>I do not teach that impermanent states</i> <i>are permanent, nor permanent ones impermanent</i>; mostly restricted to states of empiric, hence transitory, worthless, existence: nairātmyaṃ…dharmāṇāṃ Laṅk 1.4; nairātmy’ aśubhāś (so divide, as Foucaux implies) ca dharm’ ime LV 176.19 (vs); māyasamāṃs tatha svapnasamāṃś ca …samudīkṣati dharmāṃ; LV 308.9 (vs), but note in 10 that the word is used in two radically different senses, īdṛśa dharma-nayaṃ vimṛṣanto (<i>considering as such the</i> <i>rule, nature, condition, of the states of existence</i>)…dhyāyati saṃsthitu dharme, <i>he meditated…steadfast in the Doctrine</i>; dharma pratītya-samutthita buddhvā LV 308.13 (vs, just after prec.), <i>realizing that the states of being have originated</i> <i>by dependent-causation</i>; śāntāḥ kila (read with WT °lā or with Ḱ °laḥ) sarv’ imi dharm’ anāsravā…(4) na cātra kaścid bhavatīha dharmo SP 117.3--4 (vs; Burnouf and Kern take dharma in 3 as <i>law</i>), <i>all the conditions of</i> <i>being</i> (in the saint) <i>are calmed, free of the impurities</i> (so that) <i>there is not</i> (any longer) <i>in them under these conditions</i> <i>any state of</i> (conditioned, empiric) <i>existence</i>; by extension, however, even nirvāṇa is called a dharma, <i>state of being</i>: (śreṣṭho…) dharmāṇa nirvāṇaṃ iva Mv i.166.18 (vs), (Buddha is the best of creatures) <i>as nirvāṇa of states of</i> <i>being</i>; nirvṛtau…dharma (loc. sg.) RP 6.9 (vs), <i>in the</i> <i>state</i> (of) <i>nirvāṇa</i>. See also the following cpds., esp. <b>dharma-</b> [Page277-a+ 71] <b>kāya</b>. For Dharma as n. pr. see prec.; for dharma as adj. see next. I have not listed dharma <i>law, doctrine</i> (second of the 3 ratna, Dharmas 1 etc.), since it is both extremely common and hardly un-Skt. It may refer particularly to the collections of sūtras which set forth the Doctrine; see e.g. <b>dharma-caryā</b>.--dharma is also one of the four <b>pratisaṃvid</b>, q.v.; on the mg. here see esp. AbhidhK. LaV-P. vii.89. ff., with references (note Dbh 77.3 ff.); it seems likely to belong to mg. (4) but definitions are con- fusingly variant and obscure. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=276">[276,1]</a><li>3 <b>dharma</b>, f. <b>-ā</b> or (rarely) <b>-ī</b>, adj.
