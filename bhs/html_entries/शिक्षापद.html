<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>śikṣāpada</b>, nt. (Skt. in Harṣac.; = Pali sikkhāpada, see also <b>śiṣyā°</b>), <i>moral commandment</i>; as in Pali, there are five incumbent on all Buddhists, referred to as binding on an upāsaka and listed Mv iii.268.10--13, in the form of promises made, yāvajjīvaṃ prāṇātipātāt (adattādānāt, kāmehi mithyācārāt, mṛṣāvādāt, surāmaireyamadyapra- mādasthānāt) prativiramiṣyaṃ; the second five bind only monks, śrāmaṇerasya śikṣāpadaṃ iii.268.16--17, here not listed but referred to, yāvaj (this means that the first four are understood) jātarūparajatapratigrahaṇa-śikṣāpa- daṃ dhārayāmi 17; the first eight are listed Mvy 8693-- 8700 in the form of cpds. in -viratiḥ (6--8 being gandhamā- lyavilepanavarṇaka-[<i>rouge</i> etc.]-dhāraṇa-v°, uccaśayana- mahāśayana-v°, vikālabhojana-v°); here omitted is nṛtya- gītavāditā, which is separate in the Pali list but grouped with gandhamālyavilepana in AbhidhK. LaV-P. iv.47, altho this text proceeds to point out that the standard number ten is made up by separating these two (and adding the prohibition against gold etc., which curiously, in AbhidhK. as in Mvy, is left out of the formal list of eight); the order of the second group of five varies slightly in different lists; pañca śi° Mv i.211.14 = ii.15.13 (observed by the Bodhisattva's mother while carrying him); i.321.18; in Śikṣ 174.1 ff., besides the ‘five’ and ‘ten’ śi°, are men- tioned larger numbers, ye ca bodhisattvasaṃvaraṃ catur- thaṃ śataṃ (Tib. acc. to note <i>400</i>) śikṣāpadānāṃ dhāra- yanti, ye punar abhiniṣkrāntagṛhāvāsā bhikṣavaḥ (250 śi°)…dhārayanti, and 500 which nuns keep; no number, Mv iii.52.2; 265.14 (buddhaprajñapti-śi°): Divy 51.8; 549.6. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=527">[527,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शिक्षादत्तक.html">◀ śikṣādattaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शिक्षापयति.html">śikṣāpayati ▶</a></div></div>
