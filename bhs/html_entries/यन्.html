<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>yan (yaṃ) nu</b> (cf. next; in Pali represented by yan nūna), conj., <i>suppose now</i>, with opt. of 1st person; ex- tremely common in most texts, but I have failed to note it in Mv, which uses <b>yan nūna(ṃ)</b> instead: SP 73.2, 14; 322.1; LV 14.16; 95.22; 101.5; 137.17; Divy 95.10; Av i.3.4; Samādh 19.12, 14; etc.; in text of MSV regularly printed yat tu (yat tv aham…), possibly by misreading? (e.g. i.90.1). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=444">[444,2]</a><li><b>yan (yaṃ) nūna</b>, (before aham) also <b>nūnam</b> but in Mv <b>nūnāhaṃ</b>, rarely <b>nūnaṃ</b> (= Pali yan nūna, rarely nūnaṃ; cf. prec.), <i>suppose now</i>, with 1 sg. opt. or (rarely) indic.; acc. to PTSD, Pali yan nūna is or may be used in the mg. <i>suppose rather</i>, suggesting an alternative to some other course: once SP seems clearly to favor this; after yan nu…nirgamayeyaṃ SP 73.2--3, <i>suppose I cause</i> <i>them to come out…</i>, a tentative proposal, there follows: yan nūnam aham etān saṃcodayeyam 73.5, <i>suppose</i> <i>rather…</i>, with nūnam instead of nu; no other so clear case, but <i>rather</i> may, at least possibly, be meant in yaṃ nūna…SP 55.10 (vs), <i>suppose</i> (instead of entering nir- vāṇa) <i>that I</i> (reveal the Buddha-bodhi); 196.7 (vs); LV 393.2 (vs); also in yan nūnāhaṃ Mv i.35.1; 37.7; 54.12; 343.6; ii.117.18; but the mg. <i>suppose rather</i> seems hardly possible in yan nūnam aham…LV 258.21 (vs; verb here samārabhe, could be opt. or 1 sg. ind. mid.); nor in most of the following: yaṃ nūnaṃ Mv i.268.3; yan nūnāhaṃ i.51.7 (prose; verb is tiṣṭhehaṃ, see § 31.21, v.l. °eyaṃ), 14 (verb is sthātum icchāmi, pres. ind.); ii.118.5, 11 (in 11, if Senart's text is right, no verb! only dats. of nouns! since adhigami and sākṣākari in 12 seems clearly aorists, statements of fact, not dependent on yan nūnāhaṃ, which is foll. by etasyaiva dharmasya prāptaye sākṣātkriyāyai; which seems to complete the sentence); 124.9; with pres. indic. verb ii.149.21 (here <i>rather</i> is perh. possible for yan nūnāhaṃ). In Pali, besides opt., fut. indic. is recorded: Childers 603, top of 2d column; cf. tiṣṭhehaṃ Mv i.51.7, above. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=444">[444,2]</a></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="यन्त्रित.html">◀ yantrita</a></div><div id="next"><a href="यम.html">yama ▶</a></div></div>
