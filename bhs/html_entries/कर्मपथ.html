<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>karmapatha</b>, m. (nt. noted only Kv 46.1--2 daśa kuśalāni karmapathāny; = Pali kammapatha; seems to be a fundamentally Buddhist term, tho recorded once by BR in Mbh. Calc. 13.583, which is followed by a list of the ten items substantially as in Buddhism, belief in the law of fruition of actions taking the place of No. 10, absten- tion from heresy), <i>course of action</i>; almost always, as in Pali, of a set of ten good (kuśala) actions consisting in avoidance of ten bad (akuśala) actions, three of body (taking life, theft, fornication or adultery), four of speech (lying, harsh speech, spiteful speech, idle or silly, dis- connected speech), and three of mind (covetousness, malevolence, heresy); these are listed without use of the term karmapatha, as daśākuśalāni and or daśa kuśalāni, in Dharmas 56 and Mvy 1681--4, 1685--1698; but the same list is given in texts as the ten (a)kuśala karmapatha, so Mv i.107.13--15; Divy 301.22--25; 302.7--10; Śikṣ 69.13 ff. and Dbh 23.6 ff., in both of which each item is treated at some length, esp. in Śikṣ which describes the torments suffered in hell by those guilty of each of the 10 sins; in Mv ii.99.5--12 the ten karmapatha are slightly different; a fourth sin of the body (use of liquor) is added, and the number ten is kept by omitting one of the 4 sins of speech (harshness), also avidyā, <i>ignorance</i>, replaces abhidhyā, <i>covetousness</i> (this seems likely to be a mere corruption of [Page171-a+ 71] tradition); in Mv i.26.12 akuśala karmapatha is used more loosely, of sinful acts in general, specifically exemplified by the five <b>ānantarya</b>, q.v.; in Mv i.282.14 the term ten kuśala karmapatha (in prose) is immediately followed (in verses) by a list of ten vaśitā, apparently implying that they are the same (not the usual 10 karmapatha); in Suv 6.11 the expression is daśakuśalamūlakarmapatha; often a form of the verb sam-ā-dā-, <i>adopt, take to, adhere to</i>, governs the noun, as in Mv ii.77.11 daśa kuśalakarma- pathāṃ (acc. pl.) samādāya; Suv 6.11…°thaṃ samādā- payet; in Mv ii.425.10 read with mss. daśa-kuśalakarma- patha-samādānaṃ vartitvā (= vartayitvā, <i>having practised</i> <i>the taking-upon-oneself, the vow, of…</i>); cf. <b>samādiyati,</b> <b>°dāpayati, °dāna</b>; other references to the 10 kuśala, or akuśala, karmapatha, without listing, are found Mv i.3.1; 46.10; 101.18; 193.15; iii.357.14; Divy 318.22; Karmav 31.13, 14; Gv 521.4. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=170">[170,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कर्मण्येस्थित.html">◀ karmaṇyesthita</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कर्मवज्री.html">karmavajrī ▶</a></div></div>
