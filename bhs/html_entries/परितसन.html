<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>paritasana</b>, nt. (prob. MIndic for °tṛṣ° to Pali pari- tasati, and esp. °tasita, ppp., see <b>paritṛṣita</b>), <i>great longing</i>, = utkaṇṭhā: tāṃs tathāgatān apaśyan (pres. pple.) maha- tīm utkaṇṭhāṃ paritasanaṃ cāpannaḥ AsP 494.8 (prose), sc. to see the vision which had disappeared. Cf. also prec. The neg. <b>a-paritasana</b>, q.v., has been noted only as a noun from the different verb <b>parit(r)as(y)ati</b>; in Pali the two seem to be confused, at least if the Pali Dictt. are to be trusted. It must be noted, however, that the meaning <i>discouragement, mental trouble</i> (as in <b>a-parita-</b> <b>syana</b> etc., cf. <b>paritasyati, °tras°</b>) would be possible in the above AsP passage, and could also be the meaning of <b>utkaṇṭhā</b>, as in Pali ukkaṇṭhā and BHS <b>utkaṇṭhati</b>; the disappearance of the vision could lead to <i>depression</i> of mind, as well as to <i>eager desire</i> to see it again. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=324">[324,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="परितर्षण.html">◀ paritarṣaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="परितस्यति.html">paritasyati ▶</a></div></div>
