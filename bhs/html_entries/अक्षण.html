<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>akṣaṇa</b>, m. or nt. (= Pali akkhaṇa), <i>inopportune birth,</i> <i>birth under such circumstances that one cannot learn from</i> <i>a Buddha</i>. There are eight such in Pali, DN iii.287.12 ff.; AN iv. 225.19 ff. (9 in DN iii.263.31 ff.), viz.: (at a time when a Buddha is living) one is born (1) in a hell, (2) as an animal, (3) as a preta, (4) as one of the ‘long-lived gods’, (5) in border countries or barbarian regions, (6) with perverted, heretical mentality, (7) dull, stupid, incapable of distinguishing the gospel from what is inconsistent with it; or (8) he is born capable of profiting from the gospel but at a time when no Buddha exists to teach it. (DN iii.263 ff. adds as 9th, after No. 3, birth as an asura.) These same 8, transposing 6 and 7, are briefly listed Mvy 2299--2306: (1) narakāḥ, (2) tiryañcaḥ, (3) pretāḥ, (4) dīrghāyuṣo devāḥ, (5) pratyantajanapadam, (6) indriyavai- kalyam, (7) mithyādarśanam, (8) tathāgatānām anutpādaḥ. In Dharmas 134 No. 5 is put before 4, otherwise 1--7 as in Mvy, but 8 (obviously by a secondary change) is wholly different: (1) narakopapattis, (2) tiryagupapattir, (3) yamalokopapattiḥ, (4) pratyantajanapadopapattir, (5) dīrghāyuṣadevopapattir, (6) indriyavikalatā, (7) mithyā- dṛṣṭiś, (8) cittotpādavirāgitatā (seems to be a different version of 6, which corresponds to Pali 7, while 8 of the others is omitted). As opposed to these there is only one <b>kṣaṇa</b>, <i>opportune birth</i>; see s.v. Eight akṣaṇa Mv ii.363.3; LV 412.14; Śikṣ 2.4; 114.14; Gv 116.16; Suv 41.13. The word never means <i>misfortune</i> in general, but only <i>un-</i> <i>favorable birth</i>, and in most cases clearly in just the sense described above. So Śikṣ 147.14 akṣaṇagatiṃ na gacchaty anyatra sattvaparipākāt, (a Bodhisattva) <i>is not born in</i> <i>an inopportune birth, except to mature creatures</i> (the transl. misunderstands); LV 278.22 akṣaṇāni pithitāny abhūvan, and 279.19 akṣaṇāḥ pithitāḥ, are explained by Gv 112.19 sarvākṣaṇadvārakapāṭāni pithayiṣyati (or with text [Page003-a+ 71] pithapayiṣ°, see Chap. 43, s.v.) <i>he will close the door-panels</i> <i>(opening into) all the inopportune births</i>. The akṣaṇa are śodhita, <i>purified</i>, LV 53.6; 357.5, or made śūnya, <i>empty</i>, LV 358.13. Others: LV 12.3; 34.22; 275.21; 327.13; 364.7; Mv ii.358.5; 371.12; 392.5 = Śikṣ 306.1; Av i.291.12; RP 35.19; Śikṣ 69.5; Sukh 23.9; Gv 54.9 (preta-tiryaṅ- narakākṣaṇe-gatāḥ); cf. Lévi, Sūtrāl. 17.26. On SP 163.8 akṣaṇāḥ saṃvṛtā cf. Senart's note Mv i.405 f.; it is (as Senart says) certainly secondary, the original being aghā(ḥ) aghasaṃvṛtā(ḥ), <i>miseries, surrounded by miseries</i> (in ap- position with <b>lokāntarikā</b>, q.v., sc. narakāḥ or nirayāḥ); akṣaṇāḥ in SP was, in my opinion as in Senart's (if I under- stand him), a noun and a near-synonym of aghā(ḥ), <i>(constituting) unfavorable births</i>, see <b>agha</b> (2). Perhaps akṣaṇasaṃvṛtā(ḥ) was originally read after it(?). In Dbh.g. 7(343).4 read probably akṣaṇāḥ for text akṣalāḥ: sarve ti pāpapatitā 'kṣalāḥ (text) prabhonti. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=002">[002,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अक्लिष्ट.html">◀ akliṣṭa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अक्षणवेध.html">akṣaṇavedha ▶</a></div></div>
