<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>pratyaya</b>, m. (once <b>praccaya</b>, q.v.; in mg. 1 Skt.; in all mgs. = Pali paccaya), (<b>1</b>) <i>cause</i>; often clearly a synonym of hetu, tho metaphysical writers try to distin- guish the two in various ways; see e.g. AbhidhK. LaV-P. ix.241, note 3, vyākhyā: hetur āsannaḥ pratyayaḥ, viprakṛṣṭas tu pratyaya eva; janako hetuḥ, pratyayas tv ālambanamātram ity apare; paryāyāv etāv ity apare, <i>hetu is the proximate cause</i> (pratyaya), <i>the remote one is</i> <i>pratyaya rather; others say hetu is what generates (produces),</i> <i>pratyaya only the underlying condition; others say the two</i> <i>are synonyms</i>; where hetu and pratyaya occur together in parallel phrases older interpreters (Burnouf, Kern on SP, Foucaux on LV) often mistakenly render pratyaya by <i>effect</i>: ko…hetuḥ kaḥ pratyayaḥ SP 8.5; ayaṃ… hetur ayaṃ pratyayo LV 120.19; so, the two being clearly synonyms, LV 128.11; Mv i.66.7; 153.7; ii.283.19 (taddhe- tos tatpratyayāt); Divy 204.7 etc. (ko…hetuḥ kaḥ pratyayo, common here); Divy 199.12 (ahetu-pratyayaṃ, mss. °yāṃ, adv.); Mv iii.57.15 (hetu-pratyaya-cārikā, Bhvr.); Av i.82.4 (taddhetu tatpratyayaṃ ca, adverbs); with the further synonym nidāna, sahetu sapratyayaṃ ca sanidānaṃ LV 376.21 (vs), <i>with</i> (good) <i>ground, cause,</i> <i>and reason</i>; with kāraṇa (Skt.), dvau kāraṇau tasya… dvau ca pratyayau Suv 11.9 (vs), <i>two causes and reasons</i>; technically there are four pratyaya listed, viz. hetu-pr°, samanantara-pr°, <b>ālambana-</b>pr°, <b>adhipati-</b>pr° (equiv- alents among 24 paccaya in Pali, Vism. 532.11), elaborately discussed AbhidhK. LaV-P. ii.299 ff.; listed Mvy 2266-- 2270; Bbh 98.26 ff. (brief definitions); seemingly in cor- rupt form ŚsP 80.4 ālambanāmateya-samanantara-hetu- pratyayatā (see s.v. <b>adhipati</b>); in Bbh 13.21 ff. a (totally unrelated) list of 4 pratyaya and 4 (different) hetu of cittotpāda in a Bodhisattva are listed, the pratyaya being <i>occasions</i>, conjunctions of events which stimulate cittot- pāda; they are external to the Bodhisattva, while the 4 hetu seem more personal and mostly internal (the 4 hetu are gotrasaṃpad, buddha-bodhisattva-kalyāṇamitra-pari- grahaḥ, sattveṣu kāruṇyam, and saṃsāraduḥkhād… abhīrutā, 15.11 ff.); kadācit pratyayaṃ nārāgayiṣyāmi MSV ii.14.11, <i>perhaps I shall not get an occasion</i> (<i>oppor-</i> <i>tunity</i>, = avakāśa); in Mv iii.338.2, 8 are listed three pratyaya, viz. āśravā(ḥ), vighātā(ḥ), and paridāghā(ḥ), for each of the five <b>skandha</b>, q.v.; -pratyayā (ifc.), for °yāt (= Pali paccayā), abl. as adv., <i>because of…</i> (what precedes in comp.), kiṃpratyayā, <i>because of what?</i> Mv iii.65.13, 15; avidyāpratyayā, etc., various cpds., id. 15 ff.; idaṃpratyayā 66.1; esp. in the <b>pratītya-samutpāda</b>, q.v. for lists, the regular formula begins avidyāpratyayāḥ (Bhvr.) saṃskārāḥ yāvaj jātipratyayaṃ jarāmaraṇam iti Śāl 76.14, and similarly as a rule when the formula is cited in full in prose, as Mv ii.285.8 ff., iii.448.12 ff. (but even in prose it may be modulated with avoidance of this stock terminology, as Dbh 48.25 ff.); with rather clear reference to this but not in the standard formula, pratyaya- saṃbhava (Bhvr. adj., <i>dependent in origin</i>) Suv 57.14; 60.6; 61.2; otherwise used quite as in Skt., <i>cause</i>, e.g. dveṣa-pratyayopasaṃhāraḥ Av ii.129.14, see <b>upasaṃ-</b> <b>hāra</b> (1); svapratyayān (<i>based on themselves</i>) dharmān prakāśayati SP 29.8, and similarly 131.9 (vs); (<b>2</b>) in glāna-pratyaya-bhaiṣajya, <i>medicine to cure the sick</i>, the fourth of a monk's 4 <b>pariṣkāra</b>, q.v. for lists (in Kv 19.9; 20.20; 40.17 yāna is misprinted for glāna); here the word pratyaya (Tib. on Mvy 5893 misprinted gos, read gso with Tib. Index and 6139) means substantially <i>cure</i>, orig. however clearly <i>(required) means (of treatment)</i>; note that pratyaya in BHS is <i>not</i> used as equivalent of <b>pariṣkāra</b> in this sense, as Pali paccaya is alleged to be used by both Childers and PTSD; bhojana-gilānaprac- cayaṃ (semi-MIndic) Mv i.117.7 (vs); (<b>3</b>) pratyaya- buddha, one who becomes <i>a Buddha by</i> (understanding of) <i>causes</i>, = a <b>pratyeka-buddha</b>, q.v.: Śikṣ 344.7 (vs), [Page376-a+ 71] where a marginal gloss has pratyekabuddha (which would be unmetr.); so also pratyaya-jina Dbh.g. 51(77.)2; and pratyaya-yāna = pratyeka-(buddha-) yāna Śikṣ 328.8 (vs; follows śrāvakayāna, and followed by uttama-yāna = mahāyāna; misunderstood by Bendall and Rouse); the same mg. is expressed by pratyayair jinā(ḥ) LV 443.17 (vs; refers to pratyekabuddhas, mentioned two lines be- fore); the application of the term is made clear by a passage in SP ch. 3, p. 80, where first, line 5 f., we read: tatra kecit sattvāḥ paraghoṣaśravānugamanam ākāṅk- ṣamāṇā ātmaparinirvāṇahetoś caturāryasatyānubodhāya tathāgataśāsane 'bhiyujyante, ta ucyante śrāvakayānam ākāṅkṣamāṇās…(the hīnayāna followers); then, 8 f., anye sattvā anācāryakaṃ jñānaṃ damaśamatham ākāṅk- ṣamāṇā ātmaparinirvāṇahetor hetu-pratyayānubodhāya tathāgataśāsane 'bhiyujyante, ta ucyante pratyeka- buddhayānam ākāṅkṣamāṇās…; and finally, 11 ff., apare punaḥ sattvāḥ sarvajñajñānaṃ…ākāṅkṣamāṇā… sarvasattvaparinirvāṇahetos tathāgatajñānabalavaiśārad- yānubodhāya tathāgataśāsane 'bhiyujyante, ta ucyante mahāyānam ākāṅkṣamāṇās…; here it is very clearly characteristic of pratyekabuddhas that they seek <i>to</i> <i>understand</i> (anubodhāya) <i>grounds and reasons</i>, whereas śrāvakas seek to understand only <i>the four noble truths</i>, and mahāyānists seek to understand the whole <i>knowledge</i>, etc., <i>of Tathāgatas</i>. The śrāvakas are also said to be con- tent with following what they hear said by others (i.e. of the gospel); pratyekabuddhas go deeper, but not so deep as mahāyānists. In Prāt 520.9 pratyaya-pravāraṇāyā (see <b>pravāraṇā</b>) is, in a v.l., read pratyeka-prav°, which seems to have been the reading used by Chin. (<i>secrète</i>); the Pali parallel, however, Vin. iv.102.38, has cātumāsa- paccaya-pavāraṇā, and the old comm., Vin. iv.103.4 ff., understands paccaya = gilāna-paccaya, i.e. our 2 above; it may be that some confusion has occurred in the tradition; did the Prāt redactor, reading pratyaya-, have in mind both the above-mentioned use of pratyaya-buddha for pratyeka-b°, and at the same time the curious use of <b>pratyeka</b> described under that word (and did he even substitute pratyaya for it)? <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=375">[375,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="प्रत्यभिज्ञात.html">◀ pratyabhijñāta</a></div><div id="next"><a href="प्रत्ययन.html">pratyayana ▶</a></div></div>
