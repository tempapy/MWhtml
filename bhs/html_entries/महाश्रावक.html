<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>mahāśrāvaka</b> (= Pali mahāsāvaka), <i>important</i> <i>disciple</i> (of Buddha). In general BHS, like Pali, knows no definite number or list of them (Vism. 98.26 speaks of the number 80); a typical list of 26 names in SP 1.9 ff., but at the end it adds, ‘and others’; no number given in SP 33.5; 121.1; LV 6.15; Divy 489.11, etc. Only Mmk makes tentative starts at lists; twice it mentions groups of eight: Mmk 64.9 ff. Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana, Mahākāśyapa, Subhūti, Rāhula, Nanda, Bhadrika, Kaphi- ṇa; but 111.11 ff. varies (1--2 = 2--1 of 64.9 ff.; then Gavāṃpati, Piṇḍola-Bharadvāja, Pilindavatsa, 6 = 5 above, 7 = 3 above, and 8 Ānanda, who in SP 2.8 is a mere śaikṣa, excluded from the mahāśrāvaka group); in Mmk 40.25 Mahākāśyapa and Mahākātyāyana con- stitute a pair of mahāśr°; in 13.22 ff. is a very long list, including some familiar and many fanciful and textually doubtful ones; the same is true of the list of females, mahāśrāvikā, which follows in 14.19 ff. (beginning with Yaśodharā); the names in both these lists are omitted here as being largely unreliable. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=426">[426,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="महाशेष.html">◀ mahāśeṣa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="महाश्वास.html">mahāśvāsa ▶</a></div></div>
