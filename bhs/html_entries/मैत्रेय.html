<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Maitreya, (1)</b> also <b>Maitriya</b> m.c., and <b>Maitraka,</b> <b>Maitra-nātha, °nāman</b>, and perh. <b>Maitrīya</b>, qq.v.; = Pali Metteyya), n. of the next Buddha to follow Śākya- muni, predicted by him; has special ep. <b>Ajita</b>, q.v.: SP 3.9; 7.4 ff.; 302.11, 16; 307.11; 308.1; 309.1; 310.13; 311.1; 312.13; 315.5; 316.12; 327.2; 329.11; 332.5; 345.1 ff.; 478.11; Mv i.59.2 (etc., see Senart's Index); iii.240.11 ff.; 243.19; 246.16; 247.15; 330.8; LV 2.10 (first of a list of Bodhisattvas); 39.2 ff.; 422.7, 11; 443.7; 444.12; Mvy 646 (= Tib. byams pa, second in a list, after Avalokiteśvara); Divy 60.25 ff. (prediction of his history); 326.10 (in an earlier existence gave his life for a tigress); Av ii.176.3; Suv 117.5 (M°-prabhṛtīnāṃ bodhisattvānāṃ); 157.19; 239.6 (here Maitriyo, m.c.; v.l. Maitrayo); Śikṣ 15.13 etc.; Dharmas 12 (first of 8 Bodhisattvas); Sukh 2.13 (M°-pūr- vaṃgamaiś ca saṃbahulair bodhisattvair); Karmav 71.22; Mmk 40.14; 62.16, etc.; Sādh 20.8 etc.; as the first in a long list of future Buddhas Gv 441.23; as the first of a much shorter list, not over ten, Mv ii.354.17 = iii.279.1, most of the names being found at the beginning of the Gv list, which is evidently an enormous expansion of an old traditional list; even the order is nearly the same; Maitreya is succeeded by <b>Siṃha</b>, then <b>Pradyota, Ketu</b> (these two are interchanged in the Mv order), <b>Sunetra</b> [Page440-b+ 71] (in Mv preceded by <b>Jyotiṃdhara</b> or <b>Jyotīvara</b>, or the like, which Gv lacks), <b>Kusuma</b> and <b>Kusumaśrī</b> (in Mv these two are represented by ‘two Kusumas’), <b>Tiṣya</b> (so Gv, prob. unorig.; T. regularly precedes P. in lists of <i>past</i> Buddhas; Mv has instead <b>Meru</b> or <b>Maru</b>), <b>Puṣya</b> (Mv <b>Puṣpa</b>); here the Mv list ends. In Mv iii.279.19--20 there follows a reference to the four Buddhas of ‘this bhadra- kalpa’, still put in the future; these two lines seem to be a secondary addition of Mv iii.279, being not found in the parallel ii.355; because of them Senart, iii Introd. XXVI note 1, attributes the whole list to the past, which is scarcely conceivable with a list headed by Maitreya, and is disproved by the Gv parallel; in Gv 456.19 intro- ductory to long chapter on M°, Gv 466.15 ff., special glorification of him; (<b>2</b>) n. of a brahmanical gotra (sg. as n. of various persons in Skt.): pl.
