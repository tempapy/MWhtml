<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>śikṣā</b> (see also <b>śiṣyā</b>), (<b>1</b>) śi° tisraḥ (or, in Mvy 929, trīṇi śikṣāṇi), <i>(the three) instructions</i> (Pali sikkhā), viz. by the Vinaya (-piṭaka) in reference to moral conduct (adhi- śīlam), by the Sūtra in reference to thought, intellect (adhicittam), by the Abhidharma in reference to wisdom, insight (adhiprajñam); correspondingly in Pali: see Sūtrāl. xi.1; xx.17; Mvy 929; Dharmas 140; śikṣāsu RP 30.11. The words adhiśīlam etc. were orig. adverbs (adhi governing the second member, <i>in a manner referring to…</i>) and are still so used, e.g. Bbh 373.20--21 adhiśīlaṃ (and adhicit- taṃ, adhiprajñaṃ) śikṣā; loc. forms are also used in the same way, as adhicitte ca āyogaḥ Ud xxxii.27(32) = Pali Dnp. 185 (same text). These forms may be turned into adjectives: adhiśīlo vihāro Bbh 335.1; sa vihāraḥ adhi- citta ity ucyate Bbh 338.21 (this usage seems not recorded in Pali). Often the stems adhiśīla-, adhicitta-, adhiprajña- are used as prior members of cpds., in which case precise analysis becomes difficult; so Bbh 185.14; 333.2; 335.3; 338.24; 341.8; etc. But sometimes adhiprajñā-śikṣā is used as a cpd., Dharmas 140, the prior member being then evidently taken as stem of a noun. As nouns, adhi- śīla, adhicitta, and adhiprajñā, like their Pali equivalents, are used Mvy 930--2; Bbh 317.2 (parallel with adhimuktiḥ), [Page527-b+ 71] being then reinterpreted (with adhi = adhika) as <i>superior</i> <i>morality, intellect, wisdom</i>, see CPD s.vv. adhisīla, °citta, °paññā; (<b>2</b>) like Pali sikkhā (tho PTSD and Childers do not clearly recognize the fact), śikṣā also means <i>morality</i>, perhaps as a reflex of its use in the cpd. <b>śikṣā</b> (Pali sikkhā)- <b>pada</b>, q.v.: Bhīk 10a.1, after repetition of the five śikṣāpada the novīce says, teṣām…śikṣāyām anuśikṣe, <i>I (will)</i> <i>imitate them</i> (see <b>anuśikṣati</b>) <i>in moral conduct</i>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=527">[527,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शिक्षणा.html">◀ śikṣaṇā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शिक्षादत्तक.html">śikṣādattaka ▶</a></div></div>
