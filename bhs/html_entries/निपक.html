<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>nipaka, (1)</b> m., <i>chief</i> (cf. Jain Skt. nipa, doubtless semi-Skt. for AMg. ṇiva = Skt. nṛpa, Ind. Stud. 14.386): Divy 447.27; 451.20; (<b>2</b>) adj., = Pali id., in Pali tradition app. always interpreted as <i>wise, prudent</i>, and so nepakka, <i>wisdom, prudence</i>; occurs in Ud several times, mostly in vss which also occur in Pali with the same word, viz. vi.8; xii.18; xiv.13, 14; xv.6 (here text nṛpaka, not cor- rected in ed.; if genuine, could only be hyper-Sktism; the Pali vs, It. 47.3, has nipako); in all these occurrences <i>zealous</i> (see 3 below) would make quite as good sense; (<b>3</b>) in phrase nipakasyāṅgasaṃbhāraiḥ Mvy 7023 and Bbh 145.23, <i>with the collection of parts of the nipaka</i> (man)? Acc. to Tib. on Mvy, ḥgru skyaṅ, <i>zealously attending (?),</i> <i>zealous</i>, and so Chin. on Mvy appears to take nipaka; Wogihara's Index to Bbh renders it by two Chin. characters which may mean <i>constantly self-possessed</i> (possibly associat- ing the word with Pali niya, niyaka, = Skt. nija, <i>own?</i>). It would be possible to identify this occurrence of the word with mg. 2; it might mean <i>prudent, wise</i>, here; or contrariwise the occurrences under 2 might mean <i>zealous</i>. Further complication is caused by <b>niyaka</b>, which Tib. seems to interpret as the same as nipaka, suggesting graphic confusion; this is proposed in the Index to Mvy and in pw 7.352, where niyaka is assumed to stand for nipaka and the mg. <i>wise</i> is given for both Mvy passages, but doubtfully for the one here under discussion. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=297">[297,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="निन्दिय.html">◀ nindiya</a></div><div id="next"><a href="निपच्छित.html">nipacchita ▶</a></div></div>
