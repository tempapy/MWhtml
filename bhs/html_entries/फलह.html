AMg. phalaha, defined as <i>a big plank</i>, Ratnach., and identified with Skt. phalaka), some part of a gate or door: Mv i.195.13; iii.228.10 (prose; same passage; follow- ing the sentence containing <b>phalikha-</b> (q.v.)-phalakāni; in i.195.13 mss. phalaha-stārā(ḥ), Senart em. phalaka-; in iii.228.10 he reads phalaka° without v.l., but acc. to his note i p. 530, on the other passage, one ms. at least reads phalakha-stārā(ḥ); it seems reasonably clear that the AMg. form, conceivably with °kha for °ha, was read in Mv. (Cf. <b>phalikāstaraṇa?</b> but I cannot mediate between these two forms, both enigmatic.) <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=396">[396,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="फलसक.html">◀ phalasaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="फलाफल.html">phalāphala ▶</a></div></div>
