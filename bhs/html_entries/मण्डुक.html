<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>maṇḍuka</b>, m. (nt. ?), acc. to Skt. Lex. (pw 5.262) <i>a kind of drum</i>; prob. read so with Kashgar rec. twice for both edd. maṇḍaka (vv.ll. Nep. mss. madduka, maḍaka, etc.; note in KN says ‘probably to read maḍḍukā’ which is also cited in Skt. Lex. in same mg.) in SP 52.1 (vs), KN vādāpitā…yehi (Śikṣ yehī) jala-maṇḍakā vāpy-atha maṇḍakā vā, cited thus (except yehī) in Śikṣ 93.(11--)12; WT <b>carpaṭa-</b>, q.v., for vāpy-atha, no other change; Tib. for the pāda, chu la brdabs daṅ thal mo brdabs pa daṅ, apparently <i>striking on water and striking on the palms of</i> <i>the hands</i>. That some instrument, presumably of percus- sion, was meant seems clear from vādāpitā, tho I find no record of such a mg. for Tib. brdabs. These noises were made in honor of relics of Buddhas. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=416">[416,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="मण्डीलक.html">◀ maṇḍīlaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="मण्डूक.html">maṇḍūka ▶</a></div></div>
