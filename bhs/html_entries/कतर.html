<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>katara</b>, pron. adj. (see also <b>katira</b>; cf. <b>anyatara</b>; used in this way sometimes in Pali and apparently even in Skt., where however the cases are rare and not always certain), <i>which</i> (of more than two)?: Divy 102.17; 308.8; 371.23 kataraḥ (of several) kumāro…rājā bhaviṣyati; Śikṣ 75.4; KP 97.4 kataraṃ (cited Śikṣ 233.15 as katarat) cittaṃ; MSV iii.136.10 (read kataraṃ tat), 12. In LV 239.15 (Ārāḍasya dharmo…) na niryāti tat-katarasya samyagduḥkhakṣayāya, and Mv ii.119.5 (nāyaṃ) Ārāḍasya dharmo niryāti tat-katarasya (so mss.) samyagduḥkha- kṣayāye, could at best (but implausibly) be taken to mean <i>A.'s religion does not result in the complete destruction of</i> <i>the misery of anyone</i>. But Senart emended to tat-karasya, <i>of (for) the one who performs it</i> (sc. Ā.'s religion), which is confirmed by Tib. on LV de byed pa, <i>one who has done</i> <i>that</i>. It is indeed strange to find the same corruption in both texts; but the em. seems quite certain; it is con- firmed by Pali takkarassa DN i.235.17; MN i.68.12, in a quite similar phrase; and in a close parallel Mv ii.120.16 one ms. reads tatkarasya (the other corruptly taktenasya). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=166">[166,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कतमद्विध.html">◀ katamadvidha</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कतिम.html">katima ▶</a></div></div>
