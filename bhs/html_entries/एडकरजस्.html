<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>eḍaka-rajas</b> (= <b>avi-rajas</b>, q.v.), lit. <i>sheep-speck</i>, a small unit of matter; like avi-rajas Mvy 8195, it occurs LV 149.6 and Divy 645.11 in tabular lists of very small weights or measures; in all three, seven <b>śaśa-rajāṃsi</b> (q.v.) make one eḍaka-(avi-)r° and seven of these make one <b>go-rajas</b> (q.v.). Acc. to St. Julien, cited by Weber ISt. 8.436 note, the mg. is said by Hiuen Ts'ang and a Chin. transl. of LV to be <i>a grain of dust on the hide of a</i> <i>hare (sheep, beeve)</i>. But Tib. on both Mvy and LV says simply <i>hare- (sheep-, cow-) speck</i> (rdul); to be sure, Das s.v. rdul declares that glaṅ rdul means <i>a mote in the dung</i> <i>of an ox, a small particle of cowdung</i>. But this, as well as the different guess from Chin., can hardly be anything but implausible guesswork. Why should a speck on the skin, or in the dung, of an animal vary with the size of the animal? The Tib. itself gives no such indication. It seems safe to assume that <i>hare-speck, sheep-speck</i>, and <i>cow-speck</i> mean only three different sizes of small par- ticles. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=155">[155,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="एडकमूक.html">◀ eḍakamūka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="एडमूक.html">eḍamūka ▶</a></div></div>
