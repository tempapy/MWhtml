<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>bhautika</b>, (adj.?) subst. nt. (cf. Skt. id.; here in specialized mgs.), (<b>1</b>) possibly adj., <i>real</i> or <i>material</i>, in Laṅk 17.5, but the reading is very doubtful and the sense at least equally so, see s.v. <b>abhauti</b> and below; (<b>2</b>) subst. nt., <i>object of sense</i>: in Dharmas 40 = viṣaya or indriyārtha (five are listed: rūpa, śabda, gandha, rasa, and sparśa, corresponding, tho in different order, to the five mahā- bhūtāni listed in 39 just before). Acc. to Suzuki's Index to Laṅk, the Chin. versions of Laṅk indicate bhautika = <i>the</i> [Page413-a+ 52] <i>4 viṣaya</i> or <i>color, odor, flavor, contact</i> (note omission of <i>sound</i>, and the fact that in Laṅk 124.8 ākāśa is added only parenthetically; cf. the 4 dhātu of Pali, paṭhavī-, āpo-, tejo-, vāyo-dhātu, Childers, s.v.); in Laṅk 205.10 (omit bhūta-with 2 mss.) bhautika-svalakṣaṇa-vināśānu- palabdhir, evidently <i>products of the bhūtāni</i>, presumably as in Dharmas 40. The passage Laṅk 123.11--124.16 must, it seems, somehow be interpreted in the light of these passages, but is obscure to me (cf. also Laṅk 355.1). Suzuki is not very helpful on it; e.g. 124.13 na tu mahābhū- tānām certainly cannot mean <i>which</i> (primary elements) <i>are non-existent</i>, but rather: (the mahābhūtāni are the causes of the bhautikāni), <i>but not</i> (the bhautikāni) <i>of the</i> <i>mahābhūtāni</i>, i.e. <i>but not vice versa</i>. In Mvy 1847 bhau- tika-rūpam appears to be parallel and complementary to 1846 <b>upādāya-rūpam</b>, q.v.; this suggests that bhautika- rūpam = Pali bhūta-rūpa (Childers and PTSD s.v. rūpa), which acc. to Vism. = the four mahābhūtāni, earth, water, fire, and air (listed Mvy 1838--1841), contrary to Dharmas and the Chin. as cited by Suzuki, above; for the viṣayas are included among the 24 upādā(ya)-rūpa of Pali. On the basis of Mvy 1846--7 we might conjecture that in Laṅk 17.5 (see <b>abhauti</b>) abhautika = upādāya(-rūpam), and bhautika = bhautika (Pali bhūta)-rūpam. But if Dharmas and Chin. are right, bhautika would mean virtually the opposite of Pali bhūta(-rūpa). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=412">[412,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="भोस्कार.html">◀ bhoskāra</a></div><div id="next"><a href="भौम.html">bhauma ▶</a></div></div>
