<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>a-kisara-lābhin</b>, adj., and <b>°bhi-tā</b>, abstr.; also in Skt. form as <b>a-kṛcchra°</b>, <i>(state of) obtaining without</i> <i>difficulty</i>: akṛcchra-lābhī (n. sg.) Mvy 2432 = dkaḥ pa med par thob pa, and akisara-l° 2433 = tshegs med par°, or, ṅan ṅon ma yin par°; akṛcchrākisaralābhi-tā Bbh 388.13 = (acc. to note) Tib. ṅan ṅon ma yin par thob pa daṅ tshegs med par thob pa. The three Tib. translations are synonymous; it is striking that both the MIndic and the Sktized forms are recorded together in both Mvy and Bbh. Pali has both akasiralābhi(n) and akiccha°; other- wise the cpd. is not recorded. Even akṛcchra is not recorded in Skt. except for akṛcchra-laṅghya in pw 5.240 (from Rājat.; perhaps due to Buddhist influence?). See <b>kisara</b>; it appears that in Pali, too, kasira and kiccha, both histori- cally from kṛcchra, came to be understood as different words. This suggests that BHS a-kṛcchra-lābhin may be a Sktization of an older MIndic a-kiccha° (= Pali and Pkt. id.), specifically, and not of BHS <b>kisara</b>, which maintained an independent existence for a time, tho ultimately it was crowded out by the Sktized kṛcchra. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=002">[002,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अकिलासिन्.html">◀ akilāsin</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अकुतोभय.html">akutobhaya ▶</a></div></div>
