<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>abhijñā</b> (= Pali abhiññā), <i>higher or supernatural</i> <i>knowledge; intuition</i> (CPD). There are 5 or 6, in both Pali and BHS, agreeing in essence tho the order and precise forms of the names vary. In Dharmas 20, five: divyacakṣus, divyaśrotra, paracittajñāna, pūrvanivāsānusmṛti, ṛddhi; in Mvy 201--209 six, same order, with variant forms, (parasya) <b>cetaḥ-</b> (citta-)-<b>paryāya-</b> (q.v.)-jñāna, for the third; the sixth is āśravakṣayajñāna, as in Pali and else- where when 6 are named; the fifth is ṛddhividhijñāna in Mvy 208; SP 134.11 lists 5, practically as in Dharmas except that the fifth is ṛddhivimokṣakriyā, an unusual phrase, for which no v.l. is given in KN or WT; Burnouf (Lotus App. XIV, p. 821) cites his ms. as reading ṛddhi- sākṣātkriyā, which is much more plausible. Twenty abhijñā-karmāṇi are set forth in detail Mvy 210--230. In Laṅk 292.13--16 the abhijñā, collectively, are classified as to their origin in four ways (in l. 16 read with Suzuki Transl. 242 n. 1 te 'bhijñā na vipākajāḥ). References to <i>five</i> abhijñā: SP 12.4; 141.9; 254.14; Mv i.284.3; ii.33.11; in ii.96.1 attributed to brahmanical, non-Buddhist <i>ṛṣis</i>; Divy 321.3; Śikṣ 243.13 (read pañco, see p. 412, note) etc.; <i>six</i>, SP 90.7; 129.10; 150.2; 155.2; 255.4; 272.6; Mv iii.55.5 ff.; Divy 399.27, etc.; note Mv i.165.12 where ‘by abhijñā’ (abhijñāye) the Buddha attains knowledge of the Doctrine taught of old by other Buddhas; this certainly does not mean <i>memory</i>, cf. s.v. <b>abhijānāti</b>, which is commonly but wrongly rendered <i>remembers</i> in similar contexts; mahā- bhijñā- SP 66.8. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=050">[050,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अभिजीविन्.html">◀ abhijīvin</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अभिज्ञाकेतु.html">abhijñāketu ▶</a></div></div>
