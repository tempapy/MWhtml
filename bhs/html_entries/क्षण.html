<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>kṣaṇa</b>, m. (= Pali khaṇa), <i>birth under favorable</i> <i>conditions</i>. There are 8 <b>akṣaṇa</b> (q.v.) but only 1 kṣaṇa, viz., birth as a man in the ‘middle region’, where a Buddha is to be expected, at a time when he is born, and with the mental capacity to assimilate his doctrine (Pali AN iv.227.8 ff.): Mv ii.363.4 kṣaṇaṃ (acc.) ekaṃ buddhotpādaṃ suśo- bhanam; Suv 41.(13--)14(--15) (bhavantu aṣṭākṣaṇavīti- vṛttāḥ, so read) āsādayantu kṣaṇarājam (<i>the supreme</i> <i>favorable birth</i>) uttamaṃ, (labhantu buddhehi samāgamaṃ sadā); Śikṣ 2.4; 114.15 kṣaṇasampad, <i>the good luck of</i> (this) <i>favorable birth</i>; 282.1 kṣaṇa-gati-pratilabdhena <i>having</i> <i>obtained the lot of…</i>; Kv 18.19 sarvakṣaṇopapannāḥ sattvā(ḥ), <i>all creatures born under</i> (the described) <i>favorable</i> <i>conditions</i>, cf. Sūtrāl. xiii.10 kṣaṇopapatti.(In Mv ii.378.1 Senart kṣaṇāṃś ca, but keep kṣaṇāc ca with mss., <i>and</i> <i>instantly</i>.) Once, however, kṣaṇa in this sense seems to be [Page198-b+ 71] pluralized: Mv ii.392.5--6 so akṣaṇāni parivarjayitvā, kṣaṇā ca tasya bhavanti viśiṣṭā (but mss. bhavati viśiṣṭo, taking kṣaṇā as n. sg., § 8.24); the same vs Śikṣ 306.1 even makes 8 kṣaṇa, obviously as mechanical pendant to the 8 akṣaṇa; so akṣaṇaṃ vai vijahāti sarvaṃ, aṣṭakṣa- ṇāś cāsya viśiṣṭa bhonti.This is a secondary distortion. In LV 327.12 dullabho 'dya labhitaḥ kṣaṇavaro amṛto, <i>today has been obtained the immortal</i> (nectar-like?) <i>excellent</i> <i>favorable birth that is hard to obtain</i>, followed by 13… varjitā (a)kṣaṇaduḥkhā asurasurapure, <i>avoided the pains</i> <i>of unfavorable births in the cities of asuras and gods</i>; evidently both kṣaṇa and akṣaṇa (the latter includes birth as a god!) are used in their standard meanings; but here the use of kṣaṇa is not strictly logical, since the Bodhisattva himself is speaking!
