<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>prativāṇi, °ṇī</b>, f. (and <b>°ṇi</b>, nt.?; cf. <b>a-prati°</b>, which see for Pali correspondents), <i>opposition, repulsion, aversion</i> to spoken words, especially to preaching or teaching; apparently a cpd. of prati and vāṇī: °ṇī, n. sg., AsP 244.20, and °ṇiḥ, id., 484.7, both in reference to preaching or teaching; prativāṇi (? Mironov °ni without v.l., and Kyoto ed. suggests that their mss. read °ni, and that their °ṇi in text is an em.; cf. however aprativāṇi, where both edd. have °ṇi) Mvy 5239 = Tib. mi ḥphrod pa, <i>unsuitable,</i> <i>disagreeable</i> or the like; prob. of attitude towards teaching (the preceding entry is śaikṣābhir nikūjitaṃ). Form dubi- ous; ending seems confirmed by aprativāṇi; n. sg. nt.? Or possibly adverb? In pw 7.360 °vāṇi by em., rendered <i>Opposition</i>, which I think is about right. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=368">[368,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="प्रतिवहन.html">◀ prativahana</a></div><div id="next"><a href="प्रतिवाहयति.html">prativāhayati ▶</a></div></div>
