<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>lokāntarikā</b>, subst. f., usually pl. (= Pali lokan- [Page464-b+ 71] tarikā, subst., not adj., ‘scil. Niraya’, with PTSD), <i>inter-</i> <i>stice(s) between the worlds</i>; they are dark, gloomy places, a kind of purgatories: chiefly in a well-known cliché, recorded SP 163.8; LV 51.10; 410.13 (and the first part, ending andhakārās, as abbreviation, 351.22--352.1); Mv i.41.4; 229.20; 240.9; ii.162.9; iii.334.7; 341.12; Divy 204.22; 205.4, 13, 23; 206.5, 16; Samādh page 7 line 9; ŚsP 102.17 (abbreviated); and in Pali, DN ii.12.10; MN iii.120.9; AN ii.130.24; SN v.454.16. There are minor variants thruout, not all reported here, and in Mv the mss. are mostly quite corrupt and vary widely; Senart em. rashly; I shall quote a blended version which seems at least close to a common Mv text. For convenience the passage is divided into sections, (a) to (g); Divy lacks (b) and (f); ŚsP lacks (a) and (g); in Samādh, (b) is lacking, (a) and (c) come after (f); in Mv (all six passages) and in ŚsP, (b) comes after (c): (a) om. ŚsP; yā (a)pi tā (Divy adds lokasya; 204.22 lacks api tā, and so also SP; 3 of 6 Mv passages add loke) lokāntarikā (Pali lokant°); (b) omitted in Divy, Samādh, and prob. corrupt in all; I believe orig. had aghā aghasaṃvṛtā (Pali aghā asaṃvutā, for which Senart, Mv i.406, brilliantly conjectured aghā aghasaṃvutā; the Pali comms. seem to me fatuous, and I cannot feel attracted by CPD's interpretation of aghā, see s.v. <b>agha</b>; Mv supports Senart, and so in a measure do SP, LV and ŚsP); the Mv tradition seems to point to aghā aghasaṃbhūtapūrvā, in which with Senart I regard saṃbhūta as a corruption for saṃvṛta, or MIndic saṃ- vuta; close in sense, also, is aghā aghasphuṭā (<i>full of</i> <i>misery</i>), the reading of LV and ŚsP (in ŚsP after c); finally, SP, tho substituting (tāsu ya) akṣaṇāḥ for the first aghā, and omitting the 2d agha-, actually preserves saṃ- vṛtā(ḥ), alone among BHS texts (note that it has no negative! thus tending to show the corruption of the Pali); (c) andhakārā andhakāratamisrā(ḥ) (Pali andhakārā andhakāratimisā); so Samādh; SP ed. omits andhakārā (haplogr.), but v.l. has it; either it or andhakāra- is omitted in ŚsP and both LV versions (haplogr.); Divy andhās tamaso 'ndhakāratamisrā; Mv (very confused) seems orig. to have read, andhakārā andhakārāpitatvā (or °rāyitatvā) tamisrā (or ti°) tamisrāyitatvā (or ti°); (d) yatremāu (yatra ime, etc.) candrasūryā(v; or variants) evaṃ maharddhikā(v) (sometimes omitted) evaṃ mahānu- bhāvā(v); SP, LV, ŚsP, Samādh add other adjectives prec. by evaṃ; Pali yattha p'ime candimasuriyā evaṃ mahid- dhikā evaṃ mahānubhāvā; (e) ābhayā (or ābhāya, etc., Mv; Pali ābhāya) ābhāṃ (or ābhāsaṃ; om. Pali) nānu- bhavanti (so prob. orig.; LV om. nānu°; Pali nānubhonti, but SP nānubhavataḥ, Divy na pratyanubhavataḥ, ŚsP and Samādh na bhāsato, omitting ābhayā ābhāṃ before it; Mv clearly intends nābhisaṃbhuṇanti, all 6 times; Pali comm. on DN, ii.433.23, attano pabhāya na-ppahonti, on which the ‘old ṭīkā’ cited CPD glosses…obhāsituṃ an-abhisaṃbhuṇanti, cf. Mv!); (f) ? not in Pali or Divy, perh. not orig.; SP varṇenāpi varṇaṃ tejasāpi tejo nānubhava- taḥ; LV varṇena varṇaṃ tejasā tejo nābhitapato nābhiviro- cataḥ (best mss. nāti° for nābhi° both times); ŚsP, Samādh, na tapato na virocataḥ; Mv ālokena vā ālokaṃ na spha- ranti; (g) uncertain; not in ŚsP; Pali tattha pi appamāṇo uḷāro obhāso pātubhavati; SP, LV (in LV after insertion) tatrāpi (SP tāsv api) tasmin samaye mahata udārasyāva- bhāsasya (SP mahato 'vabhāsasya) prādurbhāvo 'bhūt; Divy tā api tasmin samaye udāreṇāvabhāsena sphuṭā bhavanti; Samādh tā api tasmin samaye tenāvabhāsena sphuṭā abhūvan; Mv te (once tā) pi tena obhāsena sphuṭā abhūnsuḥ, with varr. The entire cliché means approx- imately: <i>And even those world-interstitial-spaces</i>, (which are) <i>miseries and covered over with miseries, darknesses,</i> <i>glooms of darkness, --in which the moon and sun here,</i> <i>which possess such great supernatural power and dignity</i> (or <i>capacity</i>), <i>are not capable of</i> (producing) <i>light by</i> (their) [Page465-a+ 71] <i>light,…</i> (f varies too much to admit a unified rendering,) <i>even in them a great, magnificent radiance appeared (at</i> <i>that time)</i>.--Besides this cliché, lokāntarikā occurs in, na ca vedayanti duḥkhaṃ °rikā vipadyamānā (? em.) Mv ii.34.16; alone, Mvy 3062; lokadhātor °rikā duratikramā Dbh 58.11; sarva-°rikāś ca tasmin samaye mahatāva- bhāsena sphuṭā abhūvan LV 86.19 (cf. the cliché, g); (na ca bhūyo) °rikā…prajñāyante sma LV 277.9. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=464">[464,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="लोकानुवर्तना.html">◀ lokānuvartanā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="लोकाभरण.html">lokābharaṇa ▶</a></div></div>
