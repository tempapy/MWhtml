<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Kāśyapa</b> (= Pali Kassapa; Tib. ḥod sruṅs, <i>light-</i> <i>guard</i>, e.g. on Mvy 93), (<b>1</b>) n. of a former Buddha, the one immediately preceding Śākyamuni: often mentioned as having predicted the latter, and esp. as one of a group of three, the others being <b>Krakucchanda</b> and <b>Kanaka-</b> <b>muni</b>, or equivalents; see the former for list of such re- ferences; also alone (it being not always certain that this particular Buddha is meant, cf. Mv i.58.8, ref. to 90,000 Buddhas of this name), Mv i.307.4 ff.; 312.2; 318.7 ff.; [Page182-a+ 71] iii.249.8; Divy 22.4 ff.; 54.12, 25; 76.26 ff.; 192.25 ff.; 233.21 ff.; 336.21; 337.17; 344.4 ff.; 347.1 ff.; 465.25 ff.; 504.26; Av i.237.11; 247.15, et alibi; Karmav 159.7; LV 172.9; 260.10; Mmk 104.17 ff.; (<b>2</b>) n. of one of Buddha's leading disciples, also called <b>Mahā-k°</b> (= Pali Kassapa or Mahā-k°), q.v.; there is no doubt that the same person is, as a rule at least, meant by the two forms, notably Kā° in Mvy 1031; Mv iii.48.2; SP 116.4; 121.3 ff.; 144.2 ff.; 206.8 ff.; Divy 83.10 ff.; 396.1; K. is given the title dhutaguṇāgrapāraga Mv i.64.14 (ff.), where he is involved as an interlocutor at the First Council, perhaps its pre- siding officer (as in Pali, DPPN); he then and there causes Kātyāyana to discourse on the 10 bhūmi; similarly Divy 61.28 calls him dhūtaguṇa-vādinām agro, and cf. Pali AN i.23.19 where Mahākassapa is dhutavādānaṃ (v.l. dhū- taṅgadharānaṃ) agga; mentioned in Candropama Sūtra, Hoernle MR 40 ff., = Pali SN ii.197 ff. where (Mahā) Kassapa corresponds; among mahāśrāvakas, Divy 182.22; 268.6; in Divy 573.8 it appears, strangely, that ārya- kāśyapasya is an epithet of (the next word) Kātyāyanasya (pañcaśataparivārasya; in the story which follows only Mahākātyāyana appears!); it is not clear whether the same person is meant by āyuṣmān daśabalaḥ Kāśyapaḥ Divy 275.5, and 7 daśabala-Kāś°;* no monk of this title is re- corded in Pali; in Vv. comm. 148.24 Kassapassa dasaba- lassa kāle refers to the Buddha Kāś°, tho I find no evidence to support PTSD and DPPN in stating that dasabala was ‘especially’ an epithet of his, ‘to distinguish him from other Kassapas’ as DPPN says; dasabala (BHS daśa°) of course usually refers to a Buddha, and in Pali generally to the B. Gotama; there are at least four other disciples of his having this name, see <b>Uruvilvā-k°, Kumāra-k°,</b> <b>Gayā-k°, Nadī-k°; (3)</b> n. of an ascetic (ṛṣi) who once lived in the Himālaya: Mv ii.106.16, a previous birth of <b>Mahākāśyapa</b>, q.v., 114.12; (<b>4</b>) n. of another (?) ascetic (ṛṣi) who lived in the hermitage <b>sāhaṃjanī</b> (q.v.; this is not mentioned in connection with the prec. Kā°, and the stories told of them are different): Mv iii.143.13 ff. (in story of Ekaśṛṅga and Nalinī; = Pali Kassapa 9 in DPPN); prob. the same (at least also living in Sāhaṃjanī) Mv iii.362.14; 363.19. See also <b>Pūraṇa Kāśyapa; Jaṅghā-k°;</b> <b>Vṛddha-k°</b>.--*Correction in proof: MPS 49.16 names four mahāsthavirāḥ in the world (pṛthivyāṃ) at the time of Buddha's death; two of them were Daśabala-Kāśyapa (one word) and Mahā-Kāśyapa. This settles the above question; D.K. is a separate person. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=181">[181,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="काश्मीरा.html">◀ kāśmīrā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="काश्यपपरिवर्त.html">kāśyapaparivarta ▶</a></div></div>
