A parallel vs occurring in the midst of these, 385.15, has (na) tailavinduṃ jina- stūpe dattvā; and in a following vs 386.1 tailasya vinduṃ jinacetiyeṣu occurs. This suggests that possibly tālīśa (°śu, for °śaṃ?) should be read, = Pali tālīsa, tālissa, <i>a ‘powder</i> <i>or ointment’</i> (PTSD) made from the plant named in Skt. tālīśa; <b>tālīśa</b> occurs, perhaps in this mg. (associated with tailam), in Mvy 5787, see s.v. It seems at any rate appro- priate; some oily substance used in decorating a caitya is indicated.] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=179">[179,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कारित्र.html">◀ kāritra</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कारुण.html">kāruṇa ▶</a></div></div>
