<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>vibandha</b>, m., and <b>vipratibandha</b>, m. (= Pali vibandha, Pv. comm. 207.16, <i>obstacle</i>, not <i>fetter</i> with PTSD), <i>hindrance, obstacle, obstruction</i> (wrongly defined by Wogihara, Lex. 37; correctly LaV-P. on AbhidhK. vi.300, vibandha = <i>obstacle</i>); the two words have been noted (except as just stated) only in Bbh and are used there interchangeably: (129.16) bodhisattvaḥ dāna-vibandham api dāna-vibandha-pratipakṣam api (<i>what is an obstacle</i> <i>to giving, and what counteracts that obstacle</i>) yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti.(18) tatra catvāro dāna-vibandhāḥ (v.l. °viprati- bandhāḥ; they are described in detail)…(130.2) dāna- vipratibandha-pratipakṣaṃ niśṛtya (<i>taking recourse to that</i> <i>which counteracts the obstacle…</i>)…dadāti…(130.6) vighāta-kṛtaṃ dāna-vipratibandha-hetuṃ…(131.6) ca- turvidhasya dāna-vibandhasya caturvidhaṃ dāna-vipra- tibandha-pratipakṣa-jñānaṃ veditavyaṃ…(131.23) dāna- vipratibandha-pratipakṣa-jñānam upādāya; again, one of the 6 <b>upāya</b> (q.v.) of a bodhisattva is the vibandha- sthāyin (upāya), <i>that acts as a block</i> (misunderstood by Wogihara l.c.), Bbh 264.8, discussed 267.3 katamo bodhi- sattvasya vibandha-sthāyī (v.l. °stha) upāyaḥ? iha bodhi- sattvaḥ…(5) sattvānāṃ vipratibandhenāvatiṣṭhate (<i>is</i> <i>in the position of a block, hindrance</i>, to the natural, worldly behavior of creatures); the text then explains how the Bodhisattva bribes creatures to abandon their natural immorality and live morally by promising them the worldly enjoyments they crave, on that condition; in this passage vipratibandha is constantly used, 267.5, 14, 19, 24; 268.3, 6; but at the end, 268.11, vibandha-sthāyī (or rather in mss. °stha) upāyaḥ is used again, and in 268.9, just above, evaṃ vibandha-sthitasya bodhisattvasya; once more, Bbh 388.6 (aprāpteṣu caiṣu, sc. dhyānādiṣu, cf. lines 3--4) prāptaye vibandha-saṃkleśaḥ, <i>the</i> (sort of) <i>impurity</i> (one of two kinds) <i>that, when they have not been</i> <i>attained, consists in an obstacle to their attainment</i>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=494">[494,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="विबद्धयति.html">◀ vibaddhayati</a></div><div id="next"><a href="विबुद्ध.html">vibuddha ▶</a></div></div>
