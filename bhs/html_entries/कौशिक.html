<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Kauśika, (1)</b> (presumably = Skt. id. as gotra-name), n. of a brahmanical gotra: Mv ii.48.16 ff., and of an ascetic belonging to it, ii.49.3 ff.; in ii.63.18 he is called <b>Nārada</b> by personal name, which is due to a confusion in the story, the true form of which is told in Pali, Jāt. 535, where the ascetic is called (Macchari-)Kosiya (Kosika), and Nārada (= Skt. id.) appears as a quite different character; many vss of the Jāt. are paralleled in Mv, including one giving (in Mv, not in the Jāt.) the name Nārada, apparently, to the ascetic (Mv ii.55.3 = Jāt. v.395.12); (<b>2</b>) n. of a disciple of Śākyamuni, to be read in LV 1.16 instead of <b>Kasphila</b>, q.v., as proved by Tib. ḥug pa = <i>owl</i>; he may be the same as Pali 3 Kosiya in DPPN; (<b>3</b>) n. of a locality: Māy 81; see Lévi, p. 101, [Page196-b+ 71] identifying this with Skt. Kuśika; cf. also Kirfel, Kosmo graphie 90, Kauśika, n. of a people. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=196">[196,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कौशाम्बक.html">◀ kauśāmbaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कौशीद्य.html">kauśīdya ▶</a></div></div>
