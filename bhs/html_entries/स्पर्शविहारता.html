<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>sparśa-vihāra-tā</b> (once by error °vihāri-tā; etym., see below), <i>state of comfort, agreeable condition</i>: SP 248.6; Bhīk 26a.3; in comp. with preceding sukha-, Kv 18.8 (here text erroneously °vihāri-tā); 89.13; oftener with sukhaṃ as separate and parallel near-synonym, Mv i.256.10; 323.20 (here sukha-tā); 324.5; Divy 156.14; Av i.326.1; ii.93.16. See <b>asparśavihāra</b>; and <b>phāsu, phāsa,</b> <b>(a)phāṣa(ka)</b>. The Pali equivalent is (a)phāsu(ka), often with vihāra; and AMg. has phāsuya (-vihāra). Pischel 208 derives from *sparśuka; Skt. sparśavant, BHS <b>sparśana-</b> <b>vant</b>, <i>pleasant to touch</i>, suggest how the development of mg. might conceivably have taken place, but Pischel's form is unrecorded. In BHS sparśa- is the regular form in this cpd., but others occur, see above. It may be only a hyper-Sktism. The -u of the stem seems to be universally found in Pali and Pkt., and occurs in BHS, but never followed by -ka, a fact which is not helpful to Pischel's etymology. The Jain Skt. form is prāsuka, interpreted as <i>free from living creatures</i> (pra-asu; of a dwelling, vihāra, suitable for Jain monks); this looks like a fanciful hyper- Sktism. Various other etymologies have been suggested, see the Pali Dictt.; none are convincing. Note the use of phāsuṃ, phāṣaṃ as adverbs with viharati.The forms phāsa, phāṣa are recorded only in BHS. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=612">[612,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="स्पर्शनवन्त्.html">◀ sparśanavant</a></div><div id="next"><a href="स्पर्शार्गड.html">sparśārgaḍa ▶</a></div></div>
