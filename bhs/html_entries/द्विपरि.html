<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>? dvipari</b> (-vartanāveṇī), LV 256.1. If we accept dvi- pari- with all mss. and both edd. we should have to under- stand it as part of the foll. cpd.; in that case apparently parivartanā = vartanā, and with preceding dvi- the whole might mean <i>string of double beads</i> (lit. <i>spheres?</i>), i.e., [Page274-b+ 71] possibly, extra-large ones? See the whole passage cited s.v. <b>vartanā(veṇī)</b>. Note however that the close parallel LV 254.13 lacks dvipari; and Tib. on 256.1 has nothing corresponding. Note also that the preceding comparison, ending pārśve (and cited l.c.), lacks any statement of the tertium comparationis between the Bodhisattva's sides (pārśve) and the ‘ribs’ of a crab or the roof-frame of a (ruined) stable; 254.10--11 shows the point, viz. that they were ‘open’, so that light shone thru. Is it possible that dvipari goes with the preceding and contains a corruption of some form of vi-var-(cf. vivṛtāyāṃ 254.10)? Something like opt. vivare(t), vivari? The passage is prose, and MIndic forms are not normal in prose of LV; but no one knows how MIndic its original form may have been. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=274">[274,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="द्विपदक.html">◀ dvipadaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="द्विपादक.html">dvipādaka ▶</a></div></div>
