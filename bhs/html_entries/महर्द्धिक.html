<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>maharddhika</b>, f. <b>°kā</b>, Bhvr. adj. (= Pali mahiddhika, acc. to PTSD ‘always’ with mahānubhāva, but this is not true, see e.g. Pv i.10.1; Mahāvaṃsa 1.39), <i>of great</i> <i>supernatural power</i> (ṛddhi), or more loosely, <i>of great power,</i> <i>majesty</i>, or perhaps (as in Skt.) <i>of great wealth</i>; with mahānubhāva, of ṛṣis, Mv ii.49.1; 96.1, 3; of a gṛhapati, Divy 277.28 ff.; said of Buddha(s), Mv i.294.22; Av ii.199.13; of deities, Mv i.305.1; iii.302.4; Kv 10.15; Suv 101.9 (lokapālas); of Māra, said by himself, Mv ii.276.19; of miscellaneous persons, Mv ii.92.17; iii.1.3; 63.18; sometimes as final member of a cpd., the prior member denoting the class of being so designated (this usage not recorded in Pali): devamaharddhikā vā devā vā nāga-°kā vā nāgā vā etc. (long series of similar terms) Gv 75.3; [Page421-b+ 71] esp. preta-°ka, said of a class of pretas whose position as such has been mitigated, though not completely relieved, either by their own actions or by merit transferred to them by others (see <b>dakṣiṇādeśanā</b>), Divy 14.19; Av i.264.16 ff.; 273.1; even these pretas may still manifest evil propensities, Av i.265.8 ff.; altho the cpd. *peta- mahiddhika seems not to occur in Pali, the adj. mahid- dhikā is used of a petī who, like the pretas so described in BHS, was enjoying partial happiness because of some merit acquired, Pv. 1.10.1. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=421">[421,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="महन्तक.html">◀ mahantaka</a></div><div id="next"><a href="महर्द्धिप्राप्त.html">maharddhiprāpta ▶</a></div></div>
