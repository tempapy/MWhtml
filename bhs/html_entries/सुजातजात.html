<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>sujāta-jāta</b>, adj., in LV 77.16 (prose) <i>agreeable</i>, of sounds: °ta-śabdāś ca śrūyante sma, <i>and</i> (only) <i>agreeable</i> <i>sounds were heard</i>; so Tib., sgra skad sñan baḥi sgra dag kyaṅ; contrasting with ill-omened sounds (as of crows, jackals, etc.) just mentioned as abolished; here there can be no doubt of the mg. Cf. Pali Sn 548 paripuṇṇakāyo suruci sujāto cārudassano (of the Buddha). Perhaps in the same mg. sujātajātaḥ LV 112.12 (prose), in a list of epithets of Śākyamuni, <i>agreeable</i> (but Tib. here legs par skye bas skyes pa, quite literally, <i>born by a good birth</i>). Perh. also in LV 96.6; here, after the Bodhisattva's birth, (apsarases) bodhisattvamātaram upasaṃkramya sujāta- jāta-tām aklāntakāyatāṃ ca paripṛcchanti sma (Lefm. sujātajāte tām, but read with v.l. as above, and so in repetitions 8, 10, 12, 14); this, it seems, in view of the parallels, may well mean <i>approached…and inquired as</i> <i>to her agreeable</i> (physical) <i>condition and state of having</i> <i>an unwearied body</i>, despite Tib. bltams pa legs par bltam mam, lit. <i>well-born born state</i>, which Foucaux, not un- naturally, takes to refer to successful parturition; yet the BHS (with -jāta, not jāti) hardly supports this. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=598">[598,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="सुजात.html">◀ sujāta</a></div><div id="next"><a href="सुजातबुद्धि.html">sujātabuddhi ▶</a></div></div>
