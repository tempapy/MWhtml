<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>biliśa</b> (so once in Skt. for regular baḍiśa, Suparṇ., pw 4.226; and note Pkt. biḍisa, Sheth; Pali only baḷisa, bal°), <i>fishhook</i>; some form or cpd. of this word is to be read in Mv iii.259.2, for mss. bilaśa (v.l. billaśa)-tāni- kāyetsuḥ, and 260.16 (vs), same reading, except that both mss. read billa° here; evidently a verb is concealed in the end; Senart reads pāṭensuḥ, and before it bila- śatāni, which is impossible. It is possible that bilaśa- (with one ms.) is the true reading, tho it is not recorded anywhere. The phrase follows, both times, that containing <b>kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ</b> (or <b>kārṣāpaṇa°</b>), q.v., while in Pali lists of tortures kahāpaṇakaṃ regularly follows balisa- maṃsikaṃ. It is certain that we must understand some torture by means of <i>fishhooks</i>; should we read biliśa-tāṃ, <i>fishhook-condition</i>, i.e. being torn with fishhooks? The preceding words are much like those quoted as occurring before <b>kahāpaṇa-māṃsikaṃ</b>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=400">[400,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="बिम्बोपधान.html">◀ bimbopadhāna</a></div><div id="next"><a href="बीभत्सक.html">bībhatsaka ▶</a></div></div>
