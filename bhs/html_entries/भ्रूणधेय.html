<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>bhrūṇa-dheya</b> (see <b>-dheya</b>), in °yam idaṃ cittaṃ niḥsāram anidarśanam Ud xxxi.4. This cpd. of -dheya not recorded in Pali; is it a false Sktization of the trouble- some Pali word bhūna-ha or °hu? This word the Pali comms. seem evidently to misunderstand. Cf. Renou, JA 1939, p. 348 with n. 1, who connects the Pali word with Vedic and Skt. bhrūṇa-han; acc. to his note 1, the Skt. form is to be ‘restored’ in Dharmasamuccaya 16.8. Renou apparently did not know our BHS form, which seems only to complicate the question further. It is clear, in any case, that it is an uncomplimentary epithet. The Pali comms. interpret the Pali as <i>destroying prosperity</i> or <i>welfare</i>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=413">[413,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="भ्रूकुटिक.html">◀ bhrūkuṭika</a></div><div id="next"><a href="भ्रूमुख.html">bhrūmukha ▶</a></div></div>
