<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>caraka</b>, m. (not noted in Pali; rare in Skt., see pw s.v. 1 c; but recorded in AMg. as caraga-, cpd. with parivvāyaga, just as in BHS), one of a heretical sect of ascetics; regularly followed in comp. by parivrājaka, the two possibly (as allegedly in AMg., above, see Ratnach.) denoting a single sect or class of persons, rather than two: usually preceded, immediately or otherwise, by anya- tīrthika (LV 2.21; Mv iii.412.7) or anyatīrthya (SP 276.2); caraka-parivrājaka- LV 2.21; 380.12; SP 276.2; Mv iii.412.7; Śikṣ 331.11. The proper Tib. translation seems to be spyod pa pa; so both LV passages (Foucaux reads dpyod pa pa for 2.21, but my photostat of the Lib. of Congr. ed. spyod…) and SP; spyod = car-. But Jäschke defines this by Mīmāṃsaka, the correct term for which is dpyod pa pa (both terms are given for Mīmāṃsaka in Mvy 3517; Mvy seems to omit caraka); dpyod = <i>examine</i> (mīmāṃs-); Tib. tradition has confused the two. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=225">[225,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="चम्पकविमलप्रभ.html">◀ campakavimalaprabha</a></div><div id="next"><a href="चरका.html">carakā ▶</a></div></div>
