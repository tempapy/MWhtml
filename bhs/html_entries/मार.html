<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>Māra</b>, m. (= Pali id.), <i>the Evil One, the adversary</i> <i>and tempter</i>; regularly with ep. pāpīyāṃs; often styled <b>Namuci</b>, q.v.; sometimes <i>the great</i> <b>yakṣa</b>, q.v.: in the singular, so usually, as the One who tries to thwart the Bodhisattva or Buddha and his followers, SP 63.6; 64.2; 145.2, 3; LV 260.17 ff.; 267.2; 299.20 ff. (long chapter on his temptations of and attacks on Śākyamuni); Divy 144.14; 145.4; 201.22 ff.; 202.2 ff. (here, as often, tempts Buddha to enter nirvāṇa); Jm 19.20 ff.; an unspecific plurality of Māras, SP 64.3; Śikṣ 49.7 f. mārāḥ pāpīyāṃso bodhisattvasya viheṭhanām (so with ms.) upasaṃharanti; in Gv 444.12 there is a Māra named <b>Suvarṇaprabha</b> who tries to interfere with a Bodhisattva named Vimala- prabha in his quest of enlightenment; Māra is converted(!) by Upagupta, Divy 357.1 ff.; there are ten Māra-karmāṇi, <i>deeds of Satan</i>, of which an erring Bodhisattva may be guilty, Śikṣ 151.13--152.19 (listed in detail); plurality of Māras, in Pali 3, 4, or 6 (in the latter case including Abhi- saṃkhāra-māra, which has not been noted in BHS, cf. <b>abhisaṃskāra</b>), whereas in BHS they are standardly four, viz. (the order varies) Kleśa-māra, Skandha-māra, Mṛtyu-māra, and Devaputra-māra (the last means the anthropomorphic Evil One; excellent brief statements on the others, which mean in effect quasi-personifications of kleśa etc., in Childers s.v. Māro); to these corresp. Pali Kilesa-, Khandha-, Maccu-, and Devaputta-māra (but in Pali, even when the Māras number four, it need not be <i>these</i> four); only two named SP 290.9 (śrāvakāṃś) ca bodhisattvāṃś ca skandhamāreṇa vā kleśamāreṇa vā sārdhaṃ yudhyamānān…, in next line (10) sarva-māra- nirghātanaṃ; similarly in Mv iii.273.2 only two, Kleśa- māro bhagno; Devaputramāro bhagno; but usually all four are named, so Mv iii.281.7 f.; Dharmas 80; Śikṣ 198.10 f.; Sādh 20.1--2; exigences of meter may cause abbreviations, as in LV 224.18--19 where all mss. and Calc. have all four names in full, but meter requires Deva- māra instead of Devaputra°; so LV 354.11--12 (vss) anena jitu Skandhamāras tatha Mṛtyu-Kleśa-māraḥ (v.l. Mṛtyu- māra-Kleśamārāḥ, bad meter), anena jitu Devaputra- māras; four Māras referred to but not listed Dbh.g. 55(81).3, 14; Gv 472.15. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=430">[430,2]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="मायूरी.html">◀ māyūrī</a></div><div id="next"><a href="मारक.html">māraka ▶</a></div></div>
