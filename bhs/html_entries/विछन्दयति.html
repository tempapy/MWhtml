<div id="definition"><ul><li><b>vi(c)chandayati</b>, for which forms of vi-chind- occur [Page484-b+ 71] in mss., cf. also <b>vicchindika</b> and prec.; see Wogihara, Lex. (mss. vary in Bbh between a and i); in Pali (kāya-)- vicchinda occurs as title of Jāt. 293, surely meaning <i>aversion from the body</i>, not <i>cutting off of…</i>; in Pv. comm. 129.26 atidānato vicchinditukāmo clearly means <i>wanting</i> <i>to dissuade from over-generosity</i>, = BHS vi-chand-; Pali (kāya-)vicchandaniya(-kathā) and (kāya-)vicchandanika- (-sutta) cannot be separated from (kāya-)vicchinda, above; in Divy 590.24 even the v.l. vicchedayām āsuḥ occurs for vicchandayām āsuḥ. It is clear that Pali and BHS both show what must, therefore, be a very old confusion between chand- and -chi(n)d- here. As Kern (cited PTSD s.v. vicchinda), Wogihara, and some others have seen, the orig. form was surely <b>vicchandayati</b>; the forms with chi(n)d- are due to popular etym. (in some occurrences the word means something close to <i>cuts off</i>). The funda- mental mg. is <i>makes undesirous</i> (denom., vi plus chanda); so Tib. mos pa zlog pa on Mvy, ḥdun pa zlog on KP, both mg. <i>desire-deterring, desire-dissuading</i>, but on LV simply zlog par byed pa, <i>dissuasion-(deterring-)making</i>: °dayati Mvy 6527, foll. by vicakṣuḥ-karaṇāya; bhūyo- bhūyaḥ sa māṃ °dayati, bhadramukhāniṣṭo 'sya karmaṇo phalavipākaḥ Divy 10.6, similarly 11.24, <i>dissuades</i>; °dayām āsuḥ (v.l. see above) 590.24; (Māraḥ…) bodhisattvaṃ …evaṃ °dayiṣyati AsP 331.16, <i>will (try to) dissuade</i>; (iha…bodhisattvasya…pāpamitraṃ, yaḥ prajñāpāra- mitāyāṃ) carantaṃ virecayati (q.v.) vichandayati ŚsP 1185.19, modulated in the sequel (the means of dissuasion are given 1186.1 ff.; they consist of attacks on the dog- matic interpretation of Buddhism accepted in this school); (devaputrāḥ…Māraṃ…) vicchandayanti LV 333.20 and 335.10 (prose), <i>dissuade, discourage Māra</i> (by pre- dicting his defeat); °dayati vikṣipati KP 1.6; when the thing dissuaded from is expressed it is regularly abl., dānād vicchandayan Jm 24.7; (saṃgrahavastubhyo) vic- chandya Śikṣ 50.12; adattādānād °dayati Gv 155.15; vichandya (v.l. vichindya) with ablatives Bbh 16.2 ff., so also °dayet 27.12; °dayati (v.l. °chind°) 262.13; but once apparently acc., (yasmāt tvaṃ bhikṣucaraṇapranā- maṃ) māṃ °dayitum icchasi Divy 383.6, <i>since you wish</i> <i>to dissuade me</i> (against, from) <i>bowing at the feet of monks</i> (or is this acc. a Bhvr. adj., <i>me characterized by bowing</i> etc. ?). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=bhs&amp;page=484">[484,1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="विछन्दना.html">◀ vichandanā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="विछिद्र.html">vichidra ▶</a></div></div>
