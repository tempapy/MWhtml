He is called <i>Paulastya</i> as being a grandson of the sage Pulastya. Laṅkā was originally occupied by Kubera, but Rāvaṇa ousted him from it and made it his own <lbinfo n="capi+tal"></lbinfo> capital. He had ten heads (and hence his names Daśagrīva, Daśavadana &amp;c.) and twenty arms, and according to some, four legs (<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>R. 12. 88</ls> and <ls>Malli.</ls>). He is represented to have practised the most austere penance for ten thousand years in order to propitiate the god Brahman, and to have offered one head at the end of each one thousand years. Thus he offered nine of his heads and was going to offer the tenth when the God was pleased and granted him immunity from death by either god or man. On the strength of this boon he grew very tyrannical and oppressed all beings. His power became so great that even the gods are said to have acted as his domestic <lbinfo n="ser+vanta"></lbinfo> servanta. He conquered almost all the kings of the day, but is said to have been imprisoned by Kārtavīrya for   some time when he went to attack his territory. On one occasion he tried to uplift the Kailāsa mountain, but Śiva pressed it down so as to crush his <lbinfo n="fin+gers"></lbinfo> fingers under it. He, therefore, hymned Śiva for one thousand years so loudly that the God gave him the name <i>Rāvaṇa</i> and freed him from his painful position. But though he was so powerful and <lbinfo n="in+vincible"></lbinfo> invincible, the day of retribution drew near. While Rāma-who was Viṣṇu descended on earth for the destruction of this very demon-was passing his years of exile in the forest, Rāvaṇa carried off his wife Sitā and urged her to become his wife; but she persistently refused and remained loyal to her <lbinfo n="hus+band"></lbinfo> husband. At last Rāma assisted by his monkey-troops invaded Laṅkā, <lbinfo n="annihi+lated"></lbinfo> annihilated Rāvaṇa's troops and killed the demon himself. He was a worthy <lbinfo n="op+ponent"></lbinfo> opponent of Rāma, and hence the <lbinfo n="expres+sion"></lbinfo> expression:-- <sk slp1="rAmarAvaRayoryudDaM rAmarAvaRayoriva">rāmarāvaṇayoryuddhaṃ rāmarāvaṇayoriva</sk>]. </ul><b>Comp.</b><li><ul><sk slp1="--ariH">--ariḥ</sk> <ab>N.</ab> of Rāma.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--gaMgA">--gaṃgā</sk> <ab>N.</ab> of a river in Laṅkā. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0911">[0911-c]</a></ul></li></li></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="रावः.html">◀ rāvaḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="रावणिः.html">rāvaṇiḥ ▶</a></div></div>
