[He was a very wise and powerful king, and when Indra lay concealed under waters to expiate the sin of having <lbinfo n="kill+ed"></lbinfo> killed the demon Vṛtra, a Brāhmaṇa, he was asked to occupy his seat. While there he thought of winning the love of Indr<i>ani</i> and caused the seven sages to convey him in a palanquin to her house. On his way he asked each of them to be quick using the words <i>‘sarpa’</i>, <i>‘sarpa’</i> (move on, move on), when one of the sages (Agastya ?) cursed him to be a <i>‘sarpa’</i> (serpent). He fell down from the sky, and remained in that wretched state till he waś relieved from it by Yudhiṣṭhira]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0611">[0611-c]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="नहुस्.html">◀ nahus</a></div><div id="next"><a href="नहुष्य.html">nahuṣya ▶</a></div></div>
