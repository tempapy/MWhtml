[He was the son of Kuntī begotten on her by the god Sun while she was yet a virgin residing at her father's house (see Kuntī). When the child was born, Kuntī, afraid of the censure of her relatives and also of <lbinfo n="pub+lic"></lbinfo> public scandal, threw the boy into the river where he was found by Adhiratha, charioteer of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and given over to his wife Rādhā who brought him up like her own child; whence Karṇa is often called <i>Sūtaputra</i>, <i>Rādheya</i> &amp;c. Karṇa, when grown up, was made king of Aṅga by Duryodhana, and became by virtue of his many generous acts a type of charity. On one occasion Indra (whose care it was to favour his son Arjuna) disguised himself as a <lbinfo n="Brāhma+ṇa"></lbinfo> Brāhmaṇa and cajoled him out of his divine armour and ear-rings, and gave him in <lbinfo n="re+turn"></lbinfo> return a charmed javelin. With a desire to make himself proficient in the science of war, he, calling himself a Brāhmaṇa went to Paraśurāma and learnt that art from him. But his secret did not long remain concealed. On one occasion when Paraśurāma had fallen asleep with his head resting on Karṇa's lap, a worm (supposed by some to be the form <lbinfo n="assum+ed"></lbinfo> assumed by Indra himself to defeat Karṇa's object) began to eat into his lap and made a deep rent in it; but as Karṇa showed not the least sign of pain, his real character was discovered by his preceptor who cursed him that the art he had learnt would avail him not in times of need. On another occasion he was cursed by a Brāhmaṇa (whose cow he had unwittingly slain in chase) that the earth would eat up the wheel of his chariot in the hour of trial. Even with such disadvantages as these, he <lbinfo n="ac+quitted"></lbinfo> acquitted himself most valiantly in the great war between the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas, while acting as generalissimo of the Kaurava forces after Bhīṣma and Droṇa had fallen. He maintained   the field against the Pāṇḍavas for three days, but on the last day he was slain by Arjuna while the wheel of his chariot had sunk down into the earth. Karṇa was the most intimate friend of <lbinfo n="Duryo+dhana"></lbinfo> Duryodhana, and with Śakuni joined him in all the various schemes and plots that were devised from time to time for the destruction of the Pāṇḍavas.] </li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><ul><b>Comp.</b> the auditory <lbinfo n="pas+sage"></lbinfo> passage of the outer ear.</ul><ul> <lbinfo n="Yu+dhishṭhira"></lbinfo> Yudhishṭhira.</ul><ul> <i><ab>a.</ab></i> close to the ear; <sk slp1="svanasi mfdu karRAMtikacaraH">svanasi mṛdu karṇāṃtikacaraḥ</sk> <lbinfo n="ls:Ś. 1.+ 24."></lbinfo> <ls>Ś. 1. 24.</ls> <sk slp1="--aMduH --dU">--aṃduḥ --dū</sk> <i><ab>f.</ab></i> an ornament for the ear, ear-ring.</ul><ul> giving ear, listening.</ul><ul> the <lbinfo n="flap+ping"></lbinfo> flapping of the elephant's ears.</ul><ul> <i><ab>f.</ab></i> a semicircular ear-ring.</ul><ul> an ear-ornament or merely an <lbinfo n="orna+ment"></lbinfo> ornament (according to some <lbinfo n="autho+rities"></lbinfo> authorities).
