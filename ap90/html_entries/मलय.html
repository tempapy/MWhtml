<div id="definition"><ul><ul><sk slp1="malaya">malaya</sk> One of the seven principal chains of mountains in India. It is most probably to be identified with the southern portion of the Ghāts running from the south of Mysore, and forming the eastern boundary of Travancore. It is said by Bhavabhūti to be encircled by the river Kāverī (<ls>Mv. 5. 3</ls>, also <ls>R. 4. 46</ls>), and is said to teem in cardamoms, pepper, sandal, and betel-nut trees. In <ls>R. 4. 51</ls> Kālidāsa calls the mountains Malaya and Dardura ‘the two breasts of the southern region.’  <lbinfo n="Dar+dura"></lbinfo> <i>Dardura</i> is, therefore, that portion of the Ghāts, which forms the south-eastern boundary of <lbinfo n="My+sore"></lbinfo> Mysore. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1195">[1195-b]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="मत्स्य.html">◀ matsya</a></div><div id="next"><a href="महेंद्र.html">maheṃdra ▶</a></div></div>
