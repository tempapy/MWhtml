<div id="definition"><ul><ul><sk slp1="jAMbavat">jāṃbavat</sk> <i><ab>m.</ab></i> <ab>N.</ab> of a king of bears who was of signal service to Rāma at the siege of Laṅkā. He was also noted for his medical skill. [This same Jāmbavat appears to have lived up to the time of Kṛṣṇa, or perhaps he was another being of that time; for there was a fight between Kṛṣṇa and Jāmbavat for the  <lbinfo n="Sya+mantaka"></lbinfo> <i>Syamantaka</i> jewel which the latter had got from Prasena, brother of Satrājit. Kṛṣṇa vanquished Jāmbavat, who placed the jewel, along with his <lbinfo n="daugh+ter"></lbinfo> daughter Jāmbavatī, at his entire <lbinfo n="dis+posal"></lbinfo> disposal]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0512">[0512-b]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="जांबवं.html">◀ jāṃbavaṃ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="जांबीरं.html">jāṃbīraṃ ▶</a></div></div>
