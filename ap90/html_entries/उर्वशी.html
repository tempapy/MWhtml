[Urvaśī is frequently mentioned in the Ṛgveda; at her sight the seed of Mitra and Varuṇa fell down, from which arose Agastya and Vasiṣṭha; (see Agastya). Being cursed by Mitra and Varuṇa she came down to the world of mortals, and became the wife of Purūravas, whom she chanced to see while descending, and who made a very favourable impression upon her mind. She lived with him for some time, and went up to heaven at the expiration of her curse. Purūravas was sorely <lbinfo n="griev+ved"></lbinfo> grievved at her loss, but succeeded in <lbinfo n="secur+ing"></lbinfo> securing her company once more. She bore him a son named Āyus, and then left him for ever. The account given in the Vikramorvaśīyam differs in many <lbinfo n="re+spects"></lbinfo> respects, where Indra is represented to have favoured Purūravas with her <lbinfo n="life+long"></lbinfo> lifelong company though he had himself cursed her. Mythologically she is said to have sprung from the thigh of the sage Nārāyaṇa, <ab>q. v.</ab>]. <br/><b><sup>2</sup></b> Wish, <lbinfo n="ar+dent"></lbinfo> ardent desire. </ul><b>Comp.</b><li><ul><sk slp1="--tIrTaM">--tīrthaṃ</sk> <ab>N.</ab> of a sacred place referred to in Bhārata.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--ramaRaH, --sahAyaH, --vallaBaH">--ramaṇaḥ, --sahāyaḥ, --vallabhaḥ</sk> <ab>N.</ab> of <lbinfo n="Pu+rūravas"></lbinfo> Purūravas. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0341">[0341-c]</a></ul></li></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="उर्वरी.html">◀ urvarī</a></div><div id="next"><a href="उर्वारुः.html">urvāruḥ ▶</a></div></div>
