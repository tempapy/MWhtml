The story is very pathetically told in the play].</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--vAhin">--vāhin</sk> smoke. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0514">[0514-c]</a></ul></li></li></li></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="जीन.html">◀ jīna</a></div><div id="next"><a href="जीर.html">jīra ▶</a></div></div>
