[It was he who made Yājñavalkya disgorge the whole of the Yajurveda he had learnt from him which was picked up by his other <lbinfo n="pu+pils"></lbinfo> pupils in the form of <i>Tittiris</i> or partridges; and hence the Veda was called <lbinfo n="‘Tait+tirīya"></lbinfo> ‘Taittirīya’. Vaiśampāyana was celebrated for his great skill in narrating Purāṇas, and is said to have recounted the whole of the Mahābhārata to king Janamejaya]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1015">[1015-b]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="वैशद्यं.html">◀ vaiśadyaṃ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="वैशसं.html">vaiśasaṃ ▶</a></div></div>
