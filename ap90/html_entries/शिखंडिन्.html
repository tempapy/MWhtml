[Śikhaṇḍin was originally a female, being Amba born in the family of <lbinfo n="Dru+pada"></lbinfo> Drupada for wreaking her revenge upon <lbinfo n="Bhi+shma"></lbinfo> Bhishma; (see Amba). But from her very birth the girl was given out as a male child and brought up as such. In due course she was married to the daughter of Hiraṇyavarman, who was extremely sorry to find that she had got a veritable woman for her husband. Her father, therefore, resolved to attack the kingdom of Drupada for his having deceived him; but Śikhaṇḍin contrived, by <lbinfo n="practis+ing"></lbinfo> practising austere penance in a forest, to <lbinfo n="ex+change"></lbinfo> exchange her sex with a Yakṣa, and thus averted the calamity which threatened Drupada. Afterwards in the great <lbinfo n="Bhāra+tī"></lbinfo> Bhāratī war he proved a means of killing <lbinfo n="Bhī+shma"></lbinfo> Bhīshma, who declined to fight with a <lbinfo n="wo+man"></lbinfo> woman, when Arjuna put him forward as his hero. He was afterwards killed by Aśvatthāman]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1043">[1043-c]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शिखंडिका.html">◀ śikhaṃḍikā</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शिखंडिनी.html">śikhaṃḍinī ▶</a></div></div>
