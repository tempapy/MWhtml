[Once while out on hunting, he chanced to see Draupadī in the forest, and asked of her food for himself and his retinue. <lbinfo n="Drau+padī"></lbinfo> Draupadī, by virtue of her magical <i>sthāli</i>, was able to supply him with materials sufficient for their break-fast. <lbinfo n="Jaya+dratha"></lbinfo> Jayadratha was so much struck with this act, as well as her personal charms, that he asked her to elope with him. She, of course, indignantly refused, but he succeeded in carrying her off, as her husbands were out on hunting. When they returned they pursued and captured the ravisher and released Draupadī; and he himself was allowed to go after <lbinfo n="hav+ing"></lbinfo> having been subjected to many humiliations. He took a leading part in compassing the death of Abhimanyu, and met his doom at the hands of Arjuna in the great war.]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0507">[0507-b]</a></ul></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="जयंतः.html">◀ jayaṃtaḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="जर.html">jara ▶</a></div></div>
