[Droṇa was the son of the sage Bharadvāja, and was so called because the seed, which fell at the sight of a nymph called Ghṛtācī, was <lbinfo n="pre+served"></lbinfo> preserved by the sage in a droṇā. Though a Brāhmaṇa by birth, he was <lbinfo n="well+versed"></lbinfo> wellversed in the science of arms which he learnt from Paraśurāma. He <lbinfo n="after+wards"></lbinfo> afterwards taught the Kauravas and the <lbinfo n="Pāṇ+ḍavas"></lbinfo> Pāṇḍavas the science of arms and archery. When, however, the great war <lbinfo n="com+menced"></lbinfo> commenced, he attached himself to the side of the Kauravas, and after <lbinfo n="Bhī+shma"></lbinfo> Bhīshma had been mortally wounded ‘lodged in the cage of darts’ --he <lbinfo n="as+sumed"></lbinfo> assumed the command of the Kaurava forces and maintained the struggle for four successive days, achieving <lbinfo n="wonder+ful"></lbinfo>  wonderful exploits and killing thousands of warriors on the Pāṇḍava side. On the fifteenth day of the battle the fight continued even during the night, and it was on the morning of the 16th that Bhīma, at the suggestion of <lbinfo n="Kṛ+shṇa"></lbinfo> Kṛshṇa, said within Droṇa's hearing that Aśvatthāman was slain, (the fact being that an elephant <lbinfo n="nam+ed"></lbinfo> named Aśvatthāman had fallen on the field). Being at a loss to understand how that could be, he appealed to Yudhiṣṭhira, ‘the truthful’, who also, at the advice of Kṛṣṇa, gave an <lbinfo n="eva+sive"></lbinfo> evasive reply-uttered loudly the word Aśvatthāman and added ‘<i>Gaja</i> or elephant’ in a very low tone; see  <lbinfo n="ls:Ve.+ 3. 9."></lbinfo> <ls>Ve. 3. 9.</ls> Sorely grieved at the death of his only son, the kind-hearted old father fell in a swoon, and <lbinfo n="Dhṛshṭa+dyumna"></lbinfo> Dhṛshṭadyumna, his avowed enemy, took <lbinfo n="ad+vantage"></lbinfo> advantage of this circumstance, and cut off his head].</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--RaH, --Ra">--ṇaḥ, --ṇa</sk> A measure of capacity, either the same as an Āḍhaka or equal to 4 Āḍhakas or (1/16) of a Khārī, or 32 or 64 <i>shers</i>.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--RaM">--ṇaṃ</sk> <br/><b><sup>1</sup></b> A wooden vessel or cup, bucket. <br/><b><sup>2</sup></b> A tub. </ul><b>Comp.</b><li><ul><sk slp1="--AcAryaH">--ācāryaḥ</sk> see <sk slp1="droRa">droṇa</sk> above.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--kAkaH, --kAkalaH">--kākaḥ, --kākalaḥ</sk> a raven.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--kzIrA, --GA, --dugDA, --duGA">--kṣīrā, --ghā, --dugdhā, --dughā</sk> a cow yielding a droṇā of milk.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--muKaM">--mukhaṃ</sk> the capital of 400 villages.</ul><li><ul><sk slp1="--BeGaH">--bheghaḥ</sk> see <sk slp1="droRa">droṇa</sk> (2) above. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0586">[0586-a]</a></ul></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="द्रै.html">◀ drai</a></div><div id="next"><a href="द्रोणिः.html">droṇiḥ ▶</a></div></div>
