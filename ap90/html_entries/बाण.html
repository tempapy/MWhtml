<div id="definition"><ul><ul><sk slp1="bARa">bāṇa</sk> The well-known author of the Harṣacarita,   Kādambarī and Caṇḍikāśataka. Pārvatīpariṇaya and Ratnāvalī are also ascribed to him. His date is indisputably fixed by that of his patron <lbinfo n="Harsha+vardhana"></lbinfo> Harshavardhana of Kānyakubja who was reigning during the whole of Hiouen Thsang's travels in India which lasted from 629 to 645 <ab>A. D.</ab> Bāṇa must, therefore, have lived in the latter half of the sixth or the first half of the seventh century. The date of Bāṇa is useful in ascertaining the dates-at least the <i>termini ad quem</i> --of several writers mentioned by him in his introduction to the Harṣa Carita. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1191">[1191-b]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="नारायण.html">◀ nārāyaṇa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="बिल्हण.html">bilhaṇa ▶</a></div></div>
