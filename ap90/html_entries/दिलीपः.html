[He is described by <lbinfo n="Kā+lidāsa"></lbinfo> Kālidāsa as a grand ideal of what a king should be. His wife was Sudakṣiṇā, a woman in every respect worthy of her husband; but they had no issue. For this he went to his family priest <lbinfo n="Va+sishṭha"></lbinfo>  Vasishṭha who told him and his wife to serve the celestial cow Nandinī. They accordingly served her for 21 days and were on the 22nd day favoured by the cow. A glorious boy was then born who conquered the whole world and became the founder of the line of the Raghus.] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0565">[0565-a]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="दिरिपकः.html">◀ diripakaḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="दिलीरं.html">dilīraṃ ▶</a></div></div>
