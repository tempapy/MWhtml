The gods being alarmed sought the aid of the sage Agastya, who approached the mountain and requested that by bending down he would give him an easy passage to the south, and that he would retain the same position till his return. This Vindhya consented to do (because according to one account, he regarded Agastya as his teacher); but Agastya never returned from the south, and Vindhya never attained the height of Meru]. <b>--2</b> A hunter. <sk slp1="--DyA">--dhyā</sk> <b>1</b> <ab>N.</ab> of a plant (<sk slp1="labalI">labalī</sk>). <b>--2</b> Small cardamoms. <b>--Comp.</b> <sk slp1="--awavI">--aṭavī</sk> the great Vindhya forest. <sk slp1="--kUwaH">--kūṭaḥ</sk>, <sk slp1="--kUwanaM">--kūṭanaṃ</sk> epithets of the sage Agastya. <sk slp1="--vAsin">--vāsin</sk> <i><ab>m.</ab></i> an epithet of the <lbinfo n="gram+marian"></lbinfo> grammarian <sk slp1="vyAqi">vyāḍi</sk>.
