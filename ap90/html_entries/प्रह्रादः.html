[According to the <lbinfo n="Padma+Purāṇa"></lbinfo> PadmaPurāṇa, he was a Brāhmaṇa in his <lbinfo n="pre+vious"></lbinfo> previous existence, and when born as son of Hiraṇya-Kaśipu, he still retained his ardent devotion to Viṣṇu. His father, of course, did not like that his own son should be such a devout worshipper of his mortal enemies, the gods, and with the object of getting rid of him, he <lbinfo n="sub+jected"></lbinfo> subjected him to a variety of cruelties; but Prahlāda, by the favour of Viṣṇu, was quite unscathed, and began to preach with even greater earnestness than before the doctrine that Viṣṇu filled all space and was omni-present, omni-scient, omni-potent. <lbinfo n="Hiraṇya-Ka+śipu"></lbinfo> Hiraṇya-Kaśipu in a fit of exasperation asked him “If Viṣṇu is omni-present how do I not see him in the pillar of this hall”? Whereupon Prahlāda struck the pillar with his fist (according to another account, Hiraṇya-Kaśipu himself <lbinfo n="an+grily"></lbinfo> angrily kicked the pillar to convince his son of the absurdity of his faith), when Viṣṇu came out half-man and half-lion, and tore Hiraṇya-Kaśipu to pieces. <lbinfo n="Pra+hlāda"></lbinfo> Prahlāda succeeded his father, and reigned wisely and righteously.] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0769">[0769-b]</a></ul></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="प्रह्लन्निः.html">◀ prahlanniḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="प्रह्रादन.html">prahrādana ▶</a></div></div>
