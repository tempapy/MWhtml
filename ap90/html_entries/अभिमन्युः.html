[He was called <i>Abhimanyu</i> because at his very birth he appeared to be heroic, <lbinfo n="long+armed"></lbinfo> longarmed and very fiery (<sk slp1="aBivfdDaH">abhivṛddhaḥ</sk> <lbinfo n="manyurya#sya"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="manyuryasya">manyuryasya</sk>). When the Kauravas at the advice of Droṇa formed the peculiar <lbinfo n="battle+array"></lbinfo> battlearray called ‘Chakravyūha,’ hoping that, as Arjuna was away, none of the Pāṇḍavas would be able to break through it, Abhimanyu assured his <lbinfo n="un+cles"></lbinfo> uncles that he was ready to try, if they only assisted him. He accordingly <lbinfo n="en+tered"></lbinfo> entered the Vyūha, killed many <lbinfo n="war+riors"></lbinfo> warriors on the Kaurava side, and was for a time more than a match even for such veteran and elderly heroes as Droṇa, Karṇa, Duryodhana &amp;c. He could not, however, hold out long against fearful odds, and was at last overpowered and slain. He was very handsome. He had two wives, Vatsalā daughter of <lbinfo n="Bala+rāma"></lbinfo> Balarāma and Uttarā daughter of the king of Virāṭa. Uttarā was pregnant when he was slain and gave birth to a son named Parīkṣita who succeeded to the throne of Hastināpura]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0135">[0135-a]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अभिमंथः.html">◀ abhimaṃthaḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अभिमरः.html">abhimaraḥ ▶</a></div></div>
