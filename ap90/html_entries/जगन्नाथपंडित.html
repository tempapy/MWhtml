His most celebrated work is the <sk slp1="rasagaMgADara">rasagaṃgādhara</sk> a <lbinfo n="trea+tise"></lbinfo> treatise on Rhetoric or Poetics; his other works are <sk slp1="BAminIvilAsa">bhāminīvilāsa</sk>, the five <i>laharis</i> (<sk slp1="gaMgA, payUza, suDA">gaṃgā, payūṣa, sudhā</sk>, <sk slp1="amfta, karuRA">amṛta, karuṇā</sk>), and a few minor works. He is supposed to have flourished during the time of the Emperor Shah Jahan of Delhi. He must have also seen the latter end of Jehangir's reign, and the temporary accession of Dārā to the throne in 1658. His date, --at least, his active career-lay, therefore, between 1620 and 1660 <ab>A.
