[In the <lbinfo n="Aita+reya"></lbinfo> Aitareya Brāhmaṇa it is related that king Hariścandra, being childless, made a vow that on obtaining a son he would sacrifice him to the god Varuṇa. A son was born who was named Rohita, but the king put off the fulfilment of the vow under various pretexts. At last <lbinfo n="Ro+hita"></lbinfo> Rohita purchased for one hundred cows Śunaḥśepha, the middle son of <lbinfo n="Ajīgar+ta"></lbinfo> Ajīgarta, as a substitute for himself to be offered to Varuṇa. But the boy <lbinfo n="prais+ed"></lbinfo> praised Viṣṇu, Indra, and other deities, and escaped death. He was then adopted by Viśvāmitra in his own family and called by the name Devarāta]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1050">[1050-c]</a></ul></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="शुन्.html">◀ śun</a></div><div id="next"><a href="शुनकः.html">śunakaḥ ▶</a></div></div>
