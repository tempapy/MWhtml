[He was a descendant of Bhṛgu, (the son of Cyavana by his wife Āruṣī, and grandson of Bhṛgu). The Mahābhārata relates that the sons of Kārtavīrya, with the desire of destroying the descendants of Bhṛgu, killed even the children in the womb. One of the women of the family in order to preserve her embryo secreted it in her thigh (<i>ūru</i>), whence the child at its birth was called Aurva. Beholding him the sons of Kārtavīrya were struck with blindness, and his wrath gave rise to a flame which threatened to consume the whole world, had he not, at the desire of his Pitṛs, the Bhārgavas, cast it into the ocean, where it remained <lbinfo n="con+cealed"></lbinfo> concealed with the face of a horse; <ab>cf.</ab> Vaḍavāgni.
