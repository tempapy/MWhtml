[The sage Agastya is a very reputed <lbinfo n="per+sonage"></lbinfo> personage in Hindu mythology. In the <lbinfo n="Ṛg+veda"></lbinfo> Ṛgveda he and Vasiṣṭha are said to be the off-spring of Mitra and Varuṇa, whose seed fell from them at the sight of the lovely nymph Urvaśī at a sacrificial <lbinfo n="ses+sion"></lbinfo> session. Part of the seed fell into a jar and part into water; from the former arose Agastya who is, therefore, called <lbinfo n="Kum+bhayoni"></lbinfo> Kumbhayoni, Kumbhajanman, Ghaṭodbhava,   Kalaśayoni &amp;c. from the latter <lbinfo n="Vasiṣ+ṭha"></lbinfo> Vasiṣṭha. From his parentage Agastya is also called Maitrāvaruṇi, Aurvaśeya, and, as he was very small when he was born, he is also called Mānya. He is <lbinfo n="re+presented"></lbinfo> represented to have humbled the Vindhya mountains by making them prostrate themselves before him when they tried to rise higher and higher till they <lbinfo n="well+nigh"></lbinfo> wellnigh occupied the sun's disc and <lbinfo n="obstruct+ed"></lbinfo> obstructed his path, See Vindhya. (This fable is supposed by some to typify the <lbinfo n="pro+gress"></lbinfo> progress of the Āryas towards the south in their conquest and civilization of India, the humbling of the mountain standing metaphorically for the removal of <lbinfo n="phy+sical"></lbinfo> physical obstacles in their way). He is <lbinfo n="al+so"></lbinfo> also known by the names of Pītābdhi, <lbinfo n="Sa+mudra"></lbinfo> Samudra-culuka &amp;c., from another fable according to which he drank up the ocean because it had offended him and because he wished to help Indra and the gods in their wars with a class of demons called Kāleyas who had hid themselves in the waters and oppressed the three worlds in various ways. His wife was Lopāmudrā. She was also called <lbinfo n="Kauṣī+takī"></lbinfo> Kauṣītakī and Varapradā. She bore him two sons, Dṛḍhāsya and Dṛḍhasyu. In the Rāmāyaṇa Agastya plays a <lbinfo n="distin+guished"></lbinfo> distinguished part. He dwelt in a hermitage on mount Kuñjara to the south of the Vindhya and was chief of the hermits of the south. He kept under control the evil spirits who infested the south and a legend relates how he once ate up a Rākṣasa named Vātāpi, who had <lbinfo n="assum+ed"></lbinfo> assumed the form of a ram, and destroyed by a flash of his eye the Rākṣasa's brother who attempted to avenge him. In the course of his wanderings Rāma with his wife and brother came to the hermitage of Agastya who received him with the greatest kindness and became his friend, adviser and protector. He gave Rāma the bow of Viṣṇu and accompanied him to Ayodhyā when he was restored to his kingdom after his exile of 14 years. The superhuman power which the sage <lbinfo n="pos+sessed"></lbinfo> possessed is also represented by another legend, according to which he turned king Nahuṣa into a serpent and <lbinfo n="after+wards"></lbinfo> afterwards restored him to his proper form. In the south he is usually regarded as the first teacher of science and literature to the primitive Dravidian tribes, and his era is placed by Dr. Caldwell in the 7th or 6th century <ab>B. C.</ab> The Purāṇas <lbinfo n="repre+sent"></lbinfo> represent Agastya as the son of Pulastya (the sage from whom the Rākṣasas sprang) and Havirbhuvā the daughter of <lbinfo n="Kar+dama"></lbinfo> Kardama. Several ‘hymn-seers’ are <lbinfo n="mention+ed"></lbinfo> mentioned in his family, such as his two sons, Indrabāhu, Mayobhuva and Mahendra, also others who served to <lbinfo n="perpe+tuate"></lbinfo> perpetuate the family. The sage is <lbinfo n="repre+sented"></lbinfo> represented as a great philosopher, <lbinfo n="benevo+lent"></lbinfo> benevolent and kind-hearted, unsurpassed in the science of archery and to have taken a principal part in the <lbinfo n="coloniza+tion"></lbinfo> colonization of the south; <sk slp1="nirjitAsi mayA Badre">nirjitāsi mayā bhadre</sk> <lbinfo n="Sa#truhastAdamarziRA"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="SatruhastAdamarziRA . agastyena durADarzA muninA">śatruhastādamarṣiṇā . agastyena durādharṣā muninā</sk> <lbinfo n="da#kziReva"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="dakziReva dik ..">dakṣiṇeva dik ..</sk> <ls>Rām.</ls>; <sk slp1="agastyAcaritAmASAM">agastyācaritāmāśāṃ</sk> <ls>R. 4. 44</ls>; <ab>cf.</ab> also: <sk slp1="agastyo">agastyo</sk> <lbinfo n="dakziRAmASAmA#Sritya"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="dakziRAmASAmASritya naBasi sTitaH . varuRasyAtmajo yogI">dakṣiṇāmāśāmāśritya nabhasi sthitaḥ . varuṇasyātmajo yogī</sk> <lbinfo n="viM#DyavAtApimardanaH"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="viMDyavAtApimardanaH ..">viṃdhyavātāpimardanaḥ ..</sk> and <ls>R. 6. 61</ls>, <ls>Mv. 7. 14.</ls>] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0009">[0009-c]</a></li></li></li></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="अगव्यूति.html">◀ agavyūti</a></div><div id="next"><a href="अगस्ती.html">agastī ▶</a></div></div>
