<div id="definition"><ul><li><ul><sk slp1="purUravas">purūravas</sk> <i><ab>m.</ab></i> [<ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Uṇ. 4. 231</ls>] The son of Budha and Ilā and founder of the lunar race of kings. [He saw the nymph Urvaśī, while <lbinfo n="de+scending"></lbinfo> descending upon earth owing to the curse of Mitra and Varuṇa, and fell in love with her. Urvaśī, too, was enamoured of the king who was as renowned for <lbinfo n="per+sonal"></lbinfo> personal beauty as for truthfulness, <lbinfo n="devo+tion"></lbinfo> devotion, and generosity, and became his wife. They lived happily together for many days, and after she had borne him a son, she returned to the heaven. The king heavily mourned her loss, and she was pleased to repeat her visits five <lbinfo n="suc+cessive"></lbinfo> successive times and bore him five sons. But the king, who wanted her life-long company, was not evidently satisfied with this; and he obtained his desired object after he had offered oblations as directed by the Gandharvas. The story told in Vikramorvaśīya differs in many respects; so does the account given in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, based on a passage in the Ṛgveda, where it is said that Urvaśī agreed to live with <lbinfo n="Purū+ravas"></lbinfo> Purūravas on two conditions:--namely that her two rams which she loved as children must be kept near her bed-side and <lbinfo n="ne+ver"></lbinfo> never suffered to be carried away, and that he must take care never to be seen by her undressed. The Gandharvas, however, carried away the rams, and so Urvaśī disappeared]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0712">[0712-a]</a></ul></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="पुरुष्य.html">◀ puruṣya</a></div><div id="next"><a href="पुरोटिः.html">puroṭiḥ ▶</a></div></div>
