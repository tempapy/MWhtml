<div id="definition"><ul><ul><sk slp1="jamadagniH">jamadagniḥ</sk> A Brāhmaṇa and <lbinfo n="de+scendant"></lbinfo> descendant of Bhṛgu and father of Paraśurāma. [Jamadagni was the son of Ṛcīka and Satyavatī. He was a pious sage, deeply engaged in study, and is said to have <lbinfo n="obtain+ed"></lbinfo> obtained entire possession of the Vedas. His wife was Reṇukā who bore him five sons. One day when she had gone out to bathe, she beheld a loving pair of Gandharvas (according to some Citraratha and his queen) sporting and playing in the water. The lovely sight made her feel envious of their pleasure, and she <lbinfo n="return+ed"></lbinfo> returned defiled by unworthy thoughts, <lbinfo n="‘wet+ted"></lbinfo> ‘wetted but not purified by the stream’. Her husband, who was anger incarnate, <lbinfo n="see+ing"></lbinfo> seeing her shorn of the lustre of her <lbinfo n="sanc+tity"></lbinfo> sanctity, furiously scolded her, and ordered his sons, as they came in, to cut off her head. But the first four sons shrank from that cruel deed. It was only <lbinfo n="Para+śurāma"></lbinfo> Paraśurāma, the youngest, that with <lbinfo n="charac+teristic"></lbinfo> characteristic obedience to his father's <lbinfo n="com+mand"></lbinfo> command, struck off her head with his axe. The deed pacified the father's anger, and he desired Paraśurāma to ask a boon. The kind-hearted son begged that his mother might be restored to life which the father readily granted]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0507">[0507-a]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="जमनं.html">◀ jamanaṃ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="जंपती.html">jaṃpatī ▶</a></div></div>
