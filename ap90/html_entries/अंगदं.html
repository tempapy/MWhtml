For one month he got no information, and, when <lbinfo n="conse+quently"></lbinfo> consequently he determined to cast off his life, he was told by Sampāti that Sītā could be found in Laṅkā. He sent Māruti to the island and, on the latter's return with definite information, they joined Rāma at Kiṣkindhā. <lbinfo n="After+wards"></lbinfo> Afterwards when the whole host of Rāma went to Laṅkā Aṅgada was despatched to Rāvaṇa as a messenger of peace to give him a chance of saving himself in time.
