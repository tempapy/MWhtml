[He got the <i>Syamantaka</i> jewel from the sun and always wore it round his neck. He afterwards gave it to his brother Prasena, from whom it passed into the hands of the monkey-chief Jāmbavat, who got possession of it after having killed Prasena. Kṛṣṇa, however, <lbinfo n="over+took"></lbinfo> overtook Jāmbavat and vanquished him in fight after a long struggle. The <lbinfo n="monkey+chief"></lbinfo> monkeychief thereupon presented it along with his daughter to Kṛṣṇa; see <sk slp1="jAMbavat">jāṃbavat</sk>. Kṛṣṇa then gave the jewel back to its proper owner Satrājit, who out of gratitude presented it along with his daughter Satyabhāmā to him. <lbinfo n="After+wards"></lbinfo> Afterwards when Satyabhāmā was at her father's house with the jewel, <lbinfo n="Śatadhan+van"></lbinfo> Śatadhanvan, at the instigation of a Yādava named Akrūra who desired the jewel for himself, killed Satrājit and gave it to Akrūra. Śatadhanvan was <lbinfo n="after+wards"></lbinfo> afterwards killed by Kṛṣṇa, but when he found that the jewel was with Akrūra, he allowed him to retain it with <lbinfo n="him+self"></lbinfo> himself after having once shown it to the people.] <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1085">[1085-a]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="सत्रप.html">◀ satrapa</a></div><div id="next"><a href="सत्वर.html">satvara ▶</a></div></div>
