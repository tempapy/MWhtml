While, after the <lbinfo n="mar+riage"></lbinfo> marriage of Devakī with Vasudeva, he was driving the happy pair home, a heavenly voice warned Kaṃsa that the eighth child of Devakī would kill him. <lbinfo n="Thereup+on"></lbinfo> Thereupon he threw both of them into prison, loaded them with strong fetters, and kept the strictest watch over them. He took from Devakī every child as soon as it was born and slew it, and in this way he disposed of her first six <lbinfo n="child+ren"></lbinfo> children. But the 7th and 8th, Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa, were safely conveyed to Nanda's house in spite of his vigilance, and Kṛṣṇa grew up to be his slayer according to the prophecy. When Kaṃsa heard this, he was very much enraged and sent several demons to kill Kṛṣṇa, but he killed them all with ease. At last he sent Akrūra to bring the boys to Mathurā. A severe duel was fought between Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, in which the former was slain by the latter]. <sk slp1="--sA">--sā</sk> <ab>N.</ab> of a daughter of Ugrasena and sister of Kaṃsa. <b>--Comp.</b> <sk slp1="--ariH">--ariḥ</sk>, <sk slp1="arAtiH, jit, kfz, dviz, han">arātiḥ, jit, kṛṣ, dviṣ, han</sk> <i><ab>m.</ab></i> ‘slayer of Kaṃsa, <i><ab>i. e.</ab></i> Kṛṣṇa; <sk slp1="svayaM">svayaṃ</sk> <lbinfo n="saMDikA#riRA"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="saMDikAriRA kaMsAriRA dUtena">saṃdhikāriṇā kaṃsāriṇā dūtena</sk> <ls>Ve. 1</ls>; <sk slp1="nizedivAn">niṣedivān</sk> <sk slp1="kaMsakfzaH sa vizware">kaṃsakṛṣaḥ sa viṣṭare</sk> <ls>Śi. 1. 16.</ls> <sk slp1="--asTi">--asthi</sk> <i><ab>n.</ab></i> bell-metal. <sk slp1="--udBavA">--udbhavā</sk> a fragrant earth. <sk slp1="--kAraH">--kāraḥ</sk> (<sk slp1="rI">rī</sk> <i><ab>f.</ab></i>) {1} a mixed tribe; <sk slp1="kaMsakAraSaMKakArO brAhmaRAtsaMbaBUvatuH">kaṃsakāraśaṃkhakārau brāhmaṇātsaṃbabhūvatuḥ</sk> <ls>Śabdak.</ls> {2} a worker in pewter or white-brass, a bell-founder. <sk slp1="--mAkzikaM">--mākṣikaṃ</sk> a metallic substance in large grains, a sort of pyrites. <sk slp1="--vaRik">--vaṇik</sk> <i><ab>m.</ab></i> a brazier or seller of brass vessels. <sk slp1="--vaDaH --hananaM">--vadhaḥ --hananaṃ</sk> the slaying of Kaṃsa. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0365">[0365-1]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कंस्.html">◀ kaṃs</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कंसकं.html">kaṃsakaṃ ▶</a></div></div>
