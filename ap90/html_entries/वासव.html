Bhavabhūti says that she was betrothed by her father to king Saṃjaya, but that she offered herself to Udayana; (see <ls>Māl. 2</ls>). But the Vāsavadattā of Subandhu has nothing in common with the story of Vatsa, except the name of the heroine, as she is <lbinfo n="re+presented"></lbinfo> represented to have been betrothed by her father to Puṣpaketu, but carried off by Kandarpaketu. It is probable that there were several heroines bearing the name Vāsavadattā.]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0963">[0963-c]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="वासरः.html">◀ vāsaraḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="वासवी.html">vāsavī ▶</a></div></div>
