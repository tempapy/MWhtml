[He was one of the ten sons of <lbinfo n="Brah+man"></lbinfo> Brahman, being born from his right thumb, and was the chief of the patriarchs of mankind. He is said to have had many daughters, 27 of whom became the wives of the moon, thus forming the 27 lunar mansions, and 13 the wives of Kaśyapa, becoming by him the <lbinfo n="mo+thers"></lbinfo> mothers of gods, demons, men, and <lbinfo n="ani+mals"></lbinfo> animals; see <sk slp1="kaSyapa">kaśyapa</sk>. At one time Dakṣa celebrated a great sacrifice, but did not invite his daughter Satī, nor her husband Śiva, the chief of the gods. Satī, <lbinfo n="how+ever"></lbinfo> however, went to the sacrifice, but being greatly insulted threw herself into fire and perished; <ab>cf.</ab> <ls>Ku. 1. 21.</ls> When Śiva heard this he was very much <lbinfo n="pro+voked"></lbinfo> provoked, and, according to one account, himself went to the sacrifice, <lbinfo n="complete+ly"></lbinfo> completely destroyed it, and pursued Dakṣa   who assumed the form of a deer, and at last decapitated him. But Śiva is said to have afterwards restored him to life, and he thenceforward <lbinfo n="acknowledg+ed"></lbinfo> acknowledged the god's supremacy. According to another account, Śiva, when provoked, tore off a hair from his matted hair, and dashed it with great force against the ground, when lo! a powerful demon started up and awaited his orders. He was told to go and destroy Dakṣa's sacrifice; whereupon the mighty demon, attended by several demigods, went to the sacrifice, routed the gods and priests, and, according to one <lbinfo n="ac+count"></lbinfo> account, beheaded Dakṣa himself.] <b>--2</b> A cock. <b>--3</b> Fire. <b>--4</b> The bull of Śiva. <b>--5</b> A lover attached to many mistresses. <b>--6</b> An epithet of Śiva. <b>--7</b> Mental power, ability, capacity. <b>--8</b> An epithet of Viṣṇu. <b>--9</b> The right side or part; <sk slp1="vAmato jAnakI">vāmato jānakī</sk> <sk slp1="yasya dakzaBAge ca lakzmaRaH">yasya dakṣabhāge ca lakṣmaṇaḥ</sk>. <b>--10</b> Ability, power, fitness. <b>--11</b> Strength of will, energy, resoluteness. <b>--12</b> Strength, power. <b>--13</b> Bad <lbinfo n="disposi+tion"></lbinfo> disposition, wickedness. <sk slp1="--kzA">--kṣā</sk> <b>1</b> The earth. <b>--2</b> An epithet of the Ganges. <sk slp1="--kzaM">--kṣaṃ</sk> Strength, vigour. <b>--Comp.</b> <lbinfo n="--aDvara#zvaMsakaH"></lbinfo> <sk slp1="--aDvarazvaMsakaH, --kratuzvaMsin">--adhvaraṣvaṃsakaḥ, --kratuṣvaṃsin</sk> <i><ab>m.</ab></i> epithets of Śiva. <sk slp1="--kanyA, --jA, --tanayA">--kanyā, --jā, --tanayā</sk> {1} an epithet of Durgā. {2} a lunar mansion. <sk slp1="--jApatiH">--jāpatiḥ</sk> {1} the moon {2} Śiva. <sk slp1="--sutaH">--sutaḥ</sk> a god.
