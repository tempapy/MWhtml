<div id="definition"><ul><li><ul><sk slp1="BavaBUti">bhavabhūti</sk> The well-known author of the Mahāvīracarita, Mālatī Mādhava, and Uttararāmacarita. He was a native of Vidarbha and lived at the court of king Yaśovarman of Kānyakubja, who was subdued by Lalitāditya of Kāshmir (693-729 <ab>A. D.</ab>) <lbinfo n="Bhava+bhūti"></lbinfo> Bhavabhūti flourished therefore at the end of the 7th century, and this date is consistent with Bāṇa's omission of his name. All anecdotes about the contemporaneity of Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti must be rejected as absolute myths. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1192">[1192-a]</a></ul></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="भर्तृहरि.html">◀ bhartṛhari</a></div><div id="next"><a href="भारवि.html">bhāravi ▶</a></div></div>
