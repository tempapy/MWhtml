When Kṛṣṇa was taken by Akrūra to Mathurā Uddhava was implored by the citizens of Gokula to go and fetch him. He was very much attached to Kṛṣṇa. On seeing the destruction of the Yādavas to be inevitable, he went to Kṛṣṇa and asked him what to do; whereupon he was told to go to Badarikāśrama to practise penance and to secure heaven. He is the subject of two short poems, <sk slp1="udDavadUta">uddhavadūta</sk> and <sk slp1="udDavasaMdeSa">uddhavasaṃdeśa</sk>. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0308">[0308-a]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="उद्धर्षिन्.html">◀ uddharṣin</a></div><div id="next"><a href="उद्धस्त.html">uddhasta ▶</a></div></div>
