<div id="definition"><ul><ul><sk slp1="SrIharza">śrīharṣa</sk> The reputed author of the Naiṣadhacarita and of {7} or {8} other works. He is generally placed in the latter half of the 12th century. (Wilson says that Śrīharṣa succeeded his father Kalaśa in 1113, and that the Ratnāvalī, a play ascribed to the king, must have been written by him between 1113 and 1125 the close of his reign. But the Ratnāvalī must be regarded as a work of an earlier date as it is largely quoted in the Daśarūpa, a work of the last part of the 10th <lbinfo n="cen+tury"></lbinfo> century). <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=1192">[1192-b]</a></ul></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="सुबंधु.html">◀ subaṃdhu</a></div><div id="next"><a href="हर्ष.html">harṣa ▶</a></div></div>
