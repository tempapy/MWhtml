<div id="definition"><ul><li><sk slp1="pradyumnaH">pradyumnaḥ</sk> An epithet of Cupid, the god of love. [He was a son of Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī. When only six years old, he was stolen away by the demon Śambara, for he was foretold that <lbinfo n="Pra+dyumna"></lbinfo> Pradyumna would be his destroyer. <lbinfo n="Śam+bara"></lbinfo> Śambara cast the child into the roaring sea, and a large fish swallowed it. This fish was caught by a fisherman and taken to the demon; and when it was cut up, a beautiful child came out from   the belly, and Māyāvatī, the <lbinfo n="mis+tress"></lbinfo> mistress of Śambara's household, at the desire of Nārada, carefully reared him from childhood. As he grew up, she was fascinated by the beauty of his <lbinfo n="per+son"></lbinfo> person, but Pradyumna reproved her for entertaining towards himself feelings so unbecoming a mother as he considered her. But when he was told that he was not her son, but of Viṣṇu and was cast into the sea by Śambara, he became enraged, and challenging him to fight, succeeded in killing him by the force of illusions. He and Māyāvatī afterwards repaired to the house of Kṛṣṇa, where Nārada told him and Rukmi<i>ni</i> that the boy was their own and that Māyāvatī was his wife]. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0749">[0749-b]</a></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="प्रद्योतनं.html">◀ pradyotanaṃ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="प्रद्राणक.html">pradrāṇaka ▶</a></div></div>
