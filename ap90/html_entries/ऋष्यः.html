He was brought up in the forest by his father, and he saw no other human being till he nearly reached his manhood. When a great drought well nigh devastated the country of Aṅga, its king Lomapāda, at the advice of Brāhmaṇas, caused Ṛṣyaśṛṅga to be brought to him by means of a number of damsels, and gave his daughter Śāntā (adopted by him, her real father being Daśaratha) in marriage to him, who being greatly pleased caused <lbinfo n="copi+ous"></lbinfo> copious showers of rain to fall in his <lbinfo n="king+dom"></lbinfo> kingdom.
