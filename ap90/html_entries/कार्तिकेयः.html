[Kārtikeya is the Mars or the god of war of the Indian mythology. He is the son of Śiva (but born without the direct intervention of a woman). Most of his epithets have reference to the <lbinfo n="circum+stances"></lbinfo> circumstances of his birth. Śiva cast his seed into Agni (who had gone to the god in the form of a dove while he was enjoying Pārvatī's company), who being unable to bear it cast it into the Ganges; (hence Skanda is called Agnibhū, Gaṅgāputra). It was then transferred to the six <lbinfo n="Kṛt+tikās"></lbinfo> Kṛttikās (when they went to bathe in the Ganges), each of whom therefore <lbinfo n="conceiv+ed"></lbinfo> conceived and brought forth a son. But these six sons were afterwards mysteriously combined into one of extraordinary form with six heads and twelve hands and eyes, (hence he is called Kārtikeya, <lbinfo n="Shadāna+na"></lbinfo> Shadānana, Ṣaṇmukha &amp;c.). According to <lbinfo n="an+other"></lbinfo> another account the seed of Śiva was cast by the Ganges into a thicket of reeds (Śara); whence the boy was called <lbinfo n="Śara+vaṇabhava"></lbinfo> Śaravaṇabhava, or Śarajanman. He is said to have pierced the mountain Krauncha, whence his name Krauñcadāraṇa. He was the commander of the army of the gods in their war with Tāraka, a powerful demon <ab>q. v.</ab> whom he vanquished and slew; and hence his names Senānī and <lbinfo n="Tāraka+jit"></lbinfo> Tārakajit. He is represented as riding a peacock.] </ul><b>Comp.</b><li><ul><sk slp1="--prasUH">--prasūḥ</sk> <i><ab>f.</ab></i> Pārvatī, mother of Kārtikeya. <a class="pc" href="/scans/?file=ap90&amp;page=0397">[0397-c]</a></ul></li></li></ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="कार्तिकिकः.html">◀ kārtikikaḥ</a></div><div id="next"><a href="कार्त्स्न्यं.html">kārtsnyaṃ ▶</a></div></div>
