BALARĀMA <a class="pc" href="../pdfs/bor.pdf#page=852-b">[852-b]</a>. This god is not often regarded as an avatār of Vishnu, but rather as an incarnation of the great ser- pent Ananta; hence he is sometimes called SezaH or anantaH. He was the son of Vasudeva by Devakī, but was trans- ferred from the latter to the womb of Rohiṇī, the other wife of Vasudeva, and hence his name, saNkarzaRaH. Other  names for him are — (Fond of wine) priyamaDuH <i>m.</i> — (Killer of the boxer Muṣṭika) muzwikAntakaH. — (Secret in motion) guptacaraH. — (Strong and good) balaBadraH. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_balanced.html">◀ balanced</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_balcony.html">balcony ▶</a></div></div>
