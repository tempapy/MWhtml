For the twelve sanskāras or sacred symbolical rites, <i>see</i> RITE. The following are the five mahā-yajnas, or great sacraments of the Hindūs (as explained in Manu III. 70. <i>et. seq.</i>), appointed to be per- formed every day by the Grihastha, or house-keeper, for the sake of expiating the sin incurred by the involuntary destruction of minute living creatures. They refer re- spectively to what is due to five objects, viz. himself, the gods, his fore-fathers, spirits or ghosts, and men or guests. 1. Study of Scripture, with prayer and medita- tion, called brahmayajYaH or ahutaH. 2. Offering oblations to the gods in fire, called devayajYaH or hutaH. 3. Offering libations of water and cakes to the manes of deceased ancestors, called pitfyajYaH or prASitaM or SrAdDaM. 4. Casting the residue of oblations on the ground or in water, as an offering to spirits or goblins, called BUtayajYaH or baliyajYaH or prahutaH or AhutaH or baliH <i>m.</i> 5. Receiving guests, and especially Brahmans, with hospitality, called nfyajYaH or manuppayajYaH or brAhmyahutaM or brAhmyaM or brahmahutaM. The Viṣnu-Purāna adds two other sacraments, viz. ‘propagation of offspring,’ prajApatiyajYaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> and ‘observance of truth,’ satyayajYaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> but these are com- paratively modern additions. The Christian idea of a sa- crament may be expressed by saMskAraH or KrIzwaprakalpitasaMskAraH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> as, ‘the sacrament of baptism,’ jalasaMskAraH or jalasecanasaMskAraH or majjanasaMskAraH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘of the Lord's Supper,’ KrIzwaBojanasaMskAraH or KrIzwamfnyuramaraRArTakasaMskAraH. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_sacked.html">◀ sacked</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_sacramental.html">sacramental ▶</a></div></div>
