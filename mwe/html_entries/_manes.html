Oblations to the manes are made by the relations of the deceased soon after his death, and are repeated once, or, according to some, twice in every year, <i>i. e.</i> on the anniversary of the death, and on the same lunar day of the waning half of the month Bhādra. The latter are called mahAlayaH. These obsequial rites are supposed to be necessary to secure the residence of the souls of the deceased in a world appropriated to the manes. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="?search=manege">◀ manege</a></div><div id="next"><a href="?search=maneuver">maneuver ▶</a></div></div>
