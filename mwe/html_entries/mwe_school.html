There are six schools or systems of philosophy recognised by the Hindus, viz. 1. Pūrva Mī-  mānsā, pUrvvamImAMsA<sk slp1=",">,</sk> founded by Jaimini, for the purpose of illustrating and explaining the karmakānda, or ritual part of the Vedas. It gives the rationale or meaning of the ritual enjoined in those sacred books, as distinct from the theological or spiritual part of them, and acknow- ledges the principle of ekatvaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> or oneness, which it was the object of the Vedānta system more fully to investi- gate. 2. Sānkhya, sAMKyaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> ascribed to the Muni Kapila. This system is an attempt to account for the existence of the universe without the Deity, by asserting the principle of dvEtaM or duality, or, in other words, the co-ex- istence of Spirit and matter. 3. Vedānta, vedAntaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> or Uttara Mīmānsā, uttaramImAMsA<sk slp1=",">,</sk> said to have been founded by Vyāsa, and subsequently fully developed by its most celebrated teacher SaNkaraH or SaNkarAcAryyaH. This system is wholly concerned with the theological and philosophical part of the Vedas, or that part contained in the chapters called Upanishads, and its teaching is intended to oppose the duality of the Sānkhya system by shewing that the end or aim of the Vedas is ekatvaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> or the oneness of Spirit. It denies the co-existence of matter with Spirit, and hence the conclusion arrived at is the non-existence of any thing but God. 4. Nyāya, nyAyaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> founded by the inspired sage Gautama, and the most popular of all the systems. It is neither so mystical as the Vedānta, nor so fanciful as the Sānkhya. Its title signifies ‘the fitness of things,’ and it may be described as an attempt to treat of almost all subjects, according to a philosophical method and logical arrangement. 5. Vaiśeṣika, vESezikaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> a branch of the Nyāya, founded by the sage kaRAdaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> to supply what was incomplete in the aphorisms of Gautama. 6. Yoga, yogaH or Pātanjala, pAtaYjalaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> founded by the sage pataYjaliH <i>m.</i> Its object is to shew that, even in the body, there may be, to a great extent, union with the Supreme Being. These philosophical systems are contained in sacred writings called Ṣāstras. <i>See</i> the word. <i>To</i> SCHOOL <a class="pc" href="../pdfs/bor.pdf#page=714-a">[714-a]</a>, <i>v. a.</i> Sikz<sk slp1=",">,</sk> anuSikz<sk slp1=",">,</sk> upadiS<sk slp1=",">,</sk> SAs. <i>See To</i> TEACH, INSTRUCT. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_scholium.html">◀ scholium</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_school-boy.html">school-boy ▶</a></div></div>
