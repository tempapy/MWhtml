There are six schools or systems of philosophy recognised by the Hindus, viz. 1. Pūrva Mī-  mānsā, <sk slp1="pUrvvamImAMsA">pūrvvamīmāṃsā</sk>, founded by Jaimini, for the purpose of illustrating and explaining the karmakānda, or ritual part of the Vedas. It gives the rationale or meaning of the ritual enjoined in those sacred books, as distinct from the theological or spiritual part of them, and acknow- ledges the principle of <sk slp1="ekatvaM">ekatvaṃ</sk>, or oneness, which it was the object of the Vedānta system more fully to investi- gate. 2. Sānkhya, <sk slp1="sAMKyaH">sāṃkhyaḥ</sk>, ascribed to the Muni Kapila. This system is an attempt to account for the existence of the universe without the Deity, by asserting the principle of <sk slp1="dvEtaM">dvaitaṃ</sk> or duality, or, in other words, the co-ex- istence of Spirit and matter. 3. Vedānta, <sk slp1="vedAntaH">vedāntaḥ</sk>, or Uttara Mīmānsā, <sk slp1="uttaramImAMsA">uttaramīmāṃsā</sk>, said to have been founded by Vyāsa, and subsequently fully developed by its most celebrated teacher <sk slp1="SaNkaraH">śaṅkaraḥ</sk> or <sk slp1="SaNkarAcAryyaH">śaṅkarācāryyaḥ</sk>. This system is wholly concerned with the theological and philosophical part of the Vedas, or that part contained in the chapters called Upanishads, and its teaching is intended to oppose the duality of the Sānkhya system by shewing that the end or aim of the Vedas is <sk slp1="ekatvaM">ekatvaṃ</sk>, or the oneness of Spirit. It denies the co-existence of matter with Spirit, and hence the conclusion arrived at is the non-existence of any thing but God. 4. Nyāya, <sk slp1="nyAyaH">nyāyaḥ</sk>, founded by the inspired sage Gautama, and the most popular of all the systems. It is neither so mystical as the Vedānta, nor so fanciful as the Sānkhya. Its title signifies ‘the fitness of things,’ and it may be described as an attempt to treat of almost all subjects, according to a philosophical method and logical arrangement. 5. Vaiśeṣika, <sk slp1="vESezikaM">vaiśeṣikaṃ</sk>, a branch of the Nyāya, founded by the sage <sk slp1="kaRAdaH">kaṇādaḥ</sk>, to supply what was incomplete in the aphorisms of Gautama. 6. Yoga, <sk slp1="yogaH">yogaḥ</sk> or Pātanjala, <sk slp1="pAtaYjalaM">pātañjalaṃ</sk>, founded by the sage <sk slp1="pataYjaliH">patañjaliḥ</sk> <i>m.</i> Its object is to shew that, even in the body, there may be, to a great extent, union with the Supreme Being. These philosophical systems are contained in sacred writings called Ṣāstras. <i>See</i> the word. <i>To</i> SCHOOL <a class="pc" href="../pdfs/bor.pdf#page=714-a">[714-a]</a>, <i>v. a.</i> <sk slp1="Sikz">śikṣ</sk>,<sk slp1=" anuSikz"> anuśikṣ</sk>,<sk slp1=" upadiS"> upadiś</sk>,<sk slp1=" SAs"> śās</sk>. <i>See To</i> TEACH, INSTRUCT. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_scholium.html">◀ scholium</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_school-boy.html">school-boy ▶</a></div></div>
