On the banks of this river was born the beautiful boy who was destined to lead the armies of the gods, and to be the destroyer of Tāraka, a demon who, by his austerities, had alarmed both gods and men, and gained the dominion of the universe. When born, Kārtikeya was nursed by six nymphs, called the Kritti- kās, or Pleiades, who each called him her son, and, offer- ing her breast, the child assumed to himself six mouths, and received nurture from each. He is considered to be the brother of Ganeśa, who was the reputed eldest son of Śiva and Pārvatī. He is represented riding on a peacock.
