When ‘in’ is used for ‘within,’ or ‘in the midst,’ it may be expressed by antar<sk slp1=",">,</sk> antarA<sk slp1=",">,</sk> antare<sk slp1=",">,</sk> maDye. But the most frequent use of ‘in’ is expressed in Sanskrit by the locative case, without any preposition; as, ‘in the city,’ nagare<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in the night,’ rAtrO<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘a tree planted in the earth,’ pfTivyAM ropito vfkzaH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘confidence in you,’ tvayi viSvAsaH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘engaging in the acquisition of wealth,’ arTArjane pravfttiH <i>f.;</i> ‘the sun in the east,’ prAci sUryyaH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘he sinks in the mud,’ paNke majjati<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘he delights in the good of others,’ parahite ramate<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in the front of the fight,’ raRamUrdDi. In cases where ‘in’ refers to any division of time, or the manner in which any thing is done, it is usually expressed in Sanskrit by the instr. case; as, ‘in three years,’ triBir varzEH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in twelve months,’ dvAdaSaBir mAsEH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in hundreds of years,’ varzaSatEH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in an instant,’ kzaRena<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in process of time,’ kAlaparyyAyeRa<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in how long time?’ kiyatA kAlena<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in a short time,’ acireRa<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in this manner,’ anena prakAreRa<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in abundance,’ bAhulyena<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in the form of a man,’ nararUpeRa<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘in joke,’ parihAsena<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘written in Sanskrit,’ saMskftena racitaM.

Sometimes ‘in’ may be expressed by a par- ticiple; as, ‘he has pleasure in calumniating others,’ anyAn parivadan sa tupyati or parABiSaMsanaM kftvA tuzwo Bavati<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘what bravery is there in killing a sleeping man?’ kiM pOruzaM hatvA suptaM<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘he said that to me in joke,’ upahasya mAm tad avadat. The sense of ‘in,’ may be inherent in a noun; as, ‘to go in and out,’ gamanAgamane kf. ‘In as much as,’ is ex- pressed by yasmAt<sk slp1=",">,</sk> yena<sk slp1=",">,</sk> or by the abl. or instr. case of the abstract noun; as, ‘in as much as it is founded on observation,’ pratyakzamUlatvAt or pratyakzamUlatayA. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_imputer.html">◀ imputer</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_inability.html">inability ▶</a></div></div>
