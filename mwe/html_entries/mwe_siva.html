                    <div id="definition"><ul>ŚIVA <a class="pc" href="../pdfs/bor.pdf#page=746-b">[746-b]</a>, <i>s.</i> A celebrated Hindū God, the Destroyer of Creation, and therefore the most formidable of the Hindū Triad. He also personifies reproduction, since the Hindū philo- sophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without subsequent regeneration. Hence he is sometimes con- founded with Brahmā, the Creator, or first person of the Triad. He is the particular god of the Tāntṛkas, or followers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers are termed Śaivas, and although not so numerous as the Vaishnavas, exalt their god to the highest place in the heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes which properly belong to the other deities. According to them Śiva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation, his type is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin probably of the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As the god of generation and of justice, which latter character he shares with the god Yama, he is represented riding a white bull. His own colour, as well as that of the bull, is generally white, referring probably to the un- sullied purity of Justice. His throat is dark blue; his hair of a light reddish colour, and thickly matted together, and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic. He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with four, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead, pointing up and down. These are said to denote his view of the  three divisions of time, past, present, and future. He holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his relationship to water, or according to others, to show that the three great attributes of Creator, Destroyer, and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are enveloped in a tiger's skin. In his character of Time, he not only presides over its extinction, but also its as- tronomical regulation. A crescent or half-moon on his forehead indicates the measure of time by the phases of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to denote the measure of time by years, and a second neck- lace of human skulls marks the lapse and revolution of ages, and the extinction and succession of the generations of mankind. He is often represented as entirely covered with serpents, which are the emblems of immor- tality. They are bound in his hair, round his neck, wrists, waist, arms, and legs; they serve as rings for his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his con- stant companions. Śiva has more than a thousand names, which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth chapter of the Śiva Purāna. The following list of the principal of these will give the best idea of his character and attributes.
