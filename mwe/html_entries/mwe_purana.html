From this five-fold division, and from the antiquity of the stories narrated, come the general names <sk slp1="purARaM">purāṇaṃ</sk>,<sk slp1=" paYcalakzaRaM"> pañcalakṣaṇaṃ</sk>. The specific titles are as follows: 1. <sk slp1="brahmapurARaM">brahmapurāṇaṃ</sk> or <sk slp1="brAhmapurARaM">brāhmapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 2. <sk slp1="padnapurARaM">padnapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 3. <sk slp1="vizRupu-">viṣṇupu-</sk> <sk slp1="rARaM">rāṇaṃ</sk>, 4. <sk slp1="SivapurARaM">śivapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 5. <sk slp1="BAgavatapurARaM">bhāgavatapurāṇaṃ</sk> or <sk slp1="BagavatpurARaM">bhagavatpurāṇaṃ</sk>, 6. <sk slp1="nAradapurARaM">nāradapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 7. <sk slp1="mArkaRqapurARaM">mārkaṇḍapurāṇaṃ</sk>,<sk slp1=" mArkaRqeyapurARaM"> mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 8. <sk slp1="agnipurARaM">agnipurāṇaṃ</sk>, 9. <sk slp1="BavizyapurARaM">bhaviṣyapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 10. <sk slp1="brahma-">brahma-</sk> <sk slp1="vEvarttapurARaM">vaivarttapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 11. <sk slp1="liNgapurARaM">liṅgapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 12. <sk slp1="varAhapurARaM">varāhapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 13. <sk slp1="skandapurARaM">skandapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 14. <sk slp1="bAma-">bāma-</sk> <sk slp1="napurARaM">napurāṇaṃ</sk>, 15. <sk slp1="kUrmmapurARaM">kūrmmapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 16, <sk slp1="matsyapurARaM">matsyapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 17. <sk slp1="gAruqapurARaM">gāruḍapurāṇaṃ</sk>, 18. <sk slp1="brahmA-">brahmā-</sk> <sk slp1="RqapurARaM">ṇḍapurāṇaṃ</sk>. Sometimes a Purāna called the <sk slp1="vAyupurARaM">vāyupurāṇaṃ</sk> or <sk slp1="vAyavIyapurARaM">vāyavīyapurāṇaṃ</sk> is substituted for the <sk slp1="SivapurARaM">śivapurāṇaṃ</sk>, and another called the <sk slp1="narasiMhapurARaM">narasiṃhapurāṇaṃ</sk> for the <sk slp1="brahmARqapurARaM">brahmāṇḍapurāṇaṃ</sk>. These eighteen mythological works are the repository of the modern and popular religious creed of the Hindūs. They are amplifications of the two great heroic and historical poems or Itihāsa, called Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata, giving a more connected and definite explanation of the mythical fictions and historical traditions contained in those works. They are consequently remarkable for attributing paramount importance to the two divinities, Śiva and Vishnu, who, under one form or other, are almost the sole objects that are made to claim homage. Each separate Purāna cannot, therefore, be taken as a guide to Hindū belief as a whole, but rather to some separate branch of it, in which the worship of either one of these deities in particular incarnations is en- couraged in preference to that of the other. The most celebrated of them all is the fifth in the above list, or Bhāgavata Purāna, designed for the glorification of Bha- gavat or Vishnu, in the form of Krishna. This exer- cises a more direct and powerful influence on the opinions of the natives of India than any other. The third, or Vishnu Purāna, translated by Professor Wilson, is also a work of great celebrity, and conforms most closely to the definition of Panchalakshanam, <i>i. e.</i> treat- ing of five specified topics. There are also eighteen Upapuranas, or similar poems of inferior sanctity and different appellations, viz.: 1. <sk slp1="sanatkumAraM">sanatkumāraṃ</sk>, 2. <sk slp1="nArasiMhaM">nārasiṃhaṃ</sk>, 3. <sk slp1="nAra-">nāra-</sk> <sk slp1="dIyaM">dīyaṃ</sk>, 4. <sk slp1="SivaM">śivaṃ</sk>, 5. <sk slp1="durvAsasaM">durvāsasaṃ</sk>, 6. <sk slp1="kApilaM">kāpilaṃ</sk>, 7. <sk slp1="mAnavaM">mānavaṃ</sk>, 8. <sk slp1="OSAnasaM">auśānasaṃ</sk>, 9. <sk slp1="varuRaM">varuṇaṃ</sk>, 10. <sk slp1="kAlikA">kālikā</sk>, 11. <sk slp1="SamBaM">śambhaṃ</sk>, 12. <sk slp1="nandikeSvaraM">nandikeśvaraṃ</sk>, 13. <sk slp1="sOraM">sauraṃ</sk>, 14. <sk slp1="pArASaraM">pārāśaraṃ</sk>, 15. <sk slp1="AdityaM">ādityaṃ</sk>, 16. <sk slp1="mAheSvaraM">māheśvaraṃ</sk>, 17. <sk slp1="BAgavataM">bhāgavataṃ</sk>, 18. <sk slp1="vaSizWaM">vaśiṣṭhaṃ</sk>. The collector and arranger of the Purānas, as well as of the more ancient Vedas, was a sage named Krishna <sk slp1="kfzRaH">kṛṣṇaḥ</sk>, or Dwai- pāyana <sk slp1="dvEpAyanaH">dvaipāyanaḥ</sk>, or Kṛṣnadvaipāyana <sk slp1="kfzRadvEpAyanaH">kṛṣṇadvaipāyanaḥ</sk>. The surname of Vyāsa <sk slp1="vyAsaH">vyāsaḥ</sk> or ‘Arranger’ (from the root <sk slp1="as">as</sk> with <sk slp1="vi">vi</sk>, meaning to ‘dispose’ or ‘set in order’), was given to him, and is now used to denote any ex- pounder of the Vedas or Purānas. His seat is called <sk slp1="vyAsAsanaM">vyāsāsanaṃ</sk>,<sk slp1=" vyAsapIWaM"> vyāsapīṭhaṃ</sk>. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_pur.html">◀ pur</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_puranic.html">puranic ▶</a></div></div>
