According to another account he was first produced in the heart of Brahmā, and coming out in the form of a beautiful female, was looked upon by Brah- mā with amorous emotions. He is usually represented as a handsome youth, sometimes riding on a parrot, and attended by nymphs, one of whom bears his banner, which consists of a fish on a red ground. Endeavouring to influence Śiva with the passion of love for his wife Pārvatī, he discharged an arrow at him; but Śiva, enraged at the attempt, reduced him to ashes, or as some say, to a mere mental essence, by a beam of fire darted from his central eye. Afterwards the relenting god declared that he should be born again in the form of Pradyumna, son of Krishna by Māyā or Rukminī. The bow of Kāmadeva is made of flowers, with a string formed of bees, and his five arrows are each tipped with the blos- som of a flower which is devoted to, and supposed to preside over, a sense.
