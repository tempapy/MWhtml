This is the name given to the four most ancient sacred books of the Hindūs, viz. the Ṛich or Ṛig-veda fgvedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> the Yajus or Yajurveda yajurvedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> the Sāman or sAmavedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> and the Atharvan or Atharva-veda aTarvavedaH. Of these the Ṛig-veda is the most celebrated. It consists of metrical hymns or prayers termed sūktas or mantras, each stanza of which is called a ṛch, ad- dressed chiefly to the gods of the elements, Fire, Air, the Sun, &amp;c., and ascribed to different holy authors or Ṛiṣis. The Yajurveda consists principally of prayers and invo- cations applicable to the consecration of the utensils and materials of sacrificial worship. It is divided into two parts, the white and black, the former of which is attri- buted to the saint Yājnavalkya, and the latter to Tittiri. The Sama-veda is little else than a recast of the Ṛig- veda, being made up of many of the same hymns, broken into parts and arranged anew for the purpose of being chanted during various expiatory ceremonies. The Atharva-veda has little in common with the other three in its character or style. Its language indicates a different and later era, and it may therefore be regarded as a supplement to the three others. Hence it is that many passages are found in Sanskrit writings which limit the number of Vedas to three. Each of the Vedas consists of two distinct component parts, viz. the Mantra  portion, and the Brāhmaṇa portion. The Mantra por- tion is a collection or Sanhitā of sūktas, or hymns as above described, the composition of which is supposed to have taken place about twelve or thirteen centuries B. C.; the Brāhmaṇa portion is a collection of rules for the repetition of the Mantras at certain particular cere- monies, with directions for the performance of such ceremonies, and illustrative remarks explanatory of their origin. This portion of the Vedas is supposed to have been composed about seven or eight centuries B. C. The Vedas were collected and arranged into books and chapters by the sage Kṛṣnadvaipayana, surnamed Vyāsa, who is supposed to have lived in the eleventh century after Christ; <i>see</i> under PURĀNA. The Vedas collectively are often called SrutiH <i>f.</i> or AmnAyaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> and a Brāhman conversant with them SrotriyaH or SrutijYaH. — (The three Vedas) vedatrayaM -yI<sk slp1=",">,</sk> trayI<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘duty enjoined by them,’ trayIDarmmaH. — (The four Vedas) caturvedaM<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘one who is conver- sant with them,’ caturvidyaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> caturvedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> cAturvEdyaH. The Āyur-veda, or code of medicine, is regarded by some as a part of the Atharva-veda, by others as an Upa-veda, <i>see</i> under SCRIPTURE. </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="?search=veal">◀ veal</a></div><div id="next"><a href="?search=vedanga">vedanga ▶</a></div></div>
