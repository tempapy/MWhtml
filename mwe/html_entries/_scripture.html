The sacred writings of the Hindūs may be arranged under seven heads, viz. 1. Vedas, 2. Upa- nishads, 3. Vedāngas, 4. Upavedas, 5. Ṣāstras, 6. Purānas and 7. Upapurānas. The Student is referred to each separate head for a fuller explanation than is here given of the subdivisions comprised under the several titles. 1. The Vedas are four in number, viz. fgvedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> yajurvedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> sAmavedaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> aTarvavedaH. 2. The Upanishads, are the theological and philosophical chapters of the Vedas, either detached from, or comprehended in, the principal work, and collectively called vedAntaH. 3. The Vedāngas are six sacred sciences subordinate to the Vedas, viz. Pronunciation, SikzA<sk slp1=",">,</sk> De- scription of religious ceremonies, kalpaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> Grammar, vyAkaraRaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> Prosody, Candas<sk slp1=",">,</sk> Astromony, jyotizaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> Explanation of difficult and obscure phrases, niruktaM -ktiH. 4. The Upavedas, or Mi- nor vedas, are four, viz.

Ṣāstra is a title of very general application, but it is properly re- stricted to six sacred and philosophical treatises, viz. mImAM- sASAstraM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> sAMKyaSAstraM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> vedAntaSAstraM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> nyAyaSAstraM containing the branch called vESezikaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> yogaSAstraM and DarmmaSAstraM.
