                    <div id="definition"><ul>OF <a class="pc" href="../pdfs/bor.pdf#page=547-a">[547-a]</a>, <i>prep.</i> expressed generally by the genitive case; as, ‘of me,’ mama<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘of him,’ tasya<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘of that man,’ tasya puruzasya. It is frequently expressed by the crude form of a noun in the first member of a compound; as, ‘best of all,’ sarvvaSrezWaH -zWA -zWaM<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘lord of men,’ narapatiH <i>m.;</i> ‘made of wood,’ kAzWa- nirmmitaH -tA -taM. When it denotes ‘out of,’ ‘from amongst,’ it is expressed by maDyAt or maDye<sk slp1=",">,</sk> affixed to the gen. c., or crude form; as, ‘of all men,’ sarvvapuruzamaDyAt or sarvvapuruzARAM maDyAt or maDye. It may sometimes be rendered by the abl. c., in phrases where ‘from’ may be substituted in English; as, ‘of a child, or from childhood,’ bAlyAt<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘of a race of kings, or descended from a race of kings,’ rAja- kulAt prasUtaH or rAjakulaprasUtaH. It may even be rendered by the instr. c., in phrases where ‘by’ may be substituted in English; as, ‘hospitably entertained of the king,’ <i>i. e.</i> ‘by the king,’ rAjYA satkftaH. Where ‘of’ denotes ‘property,’ ‘possession,’ ‘connexion with,’ ‘belonging to,’ &amp;c., it may either be expressed by the use of such words as sambanDI -nDinI &amp;c., vizayaH -yA -yaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> vizayakaH &amp;c., or by the gen. case, as in some of the foregoing examples. Very frequently an adjective compound involves some of these senses of the preposition; as, ‘a bird of a red color,’ raktavarRaH pakzI<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘a man of great valor,’ mahAvIryyaH puruzaH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘a woman of great wealth,’ mahADanA strI. For the other senses of this preposition, <i>see</i> ‘by,’ ‘from,’ ‘out,’ ‘among.’ ‘Of late,’ arvAk<sk slp1=",">,</sk> arvAkkAle<sk slp1=",">,</sk> nUtanakAle<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘of old,’ purA<sk slp1=",">,</sk> purastAt<sk slp1=",">,</sk> pUrvvaM<sk slp1=",">,</sk> prAkkAle<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘son of a grandson,’ prapOtraH<sk slp1=";">;</sk> ‘pupil of a pupil,’ praSizyaH<sk slp1=",">,</sk> </ul></div><div id="nav"><div id="prev"><a href="mwe_oesophagus.html">◀ oesophagus</a></div><div id="next"><a href="mwe_off.html">off ▶</a></div></div>
