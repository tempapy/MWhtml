Kapila. It asserts duality <s_dropdown>dvaitaṃ,</s_dropdown> or the co-existence of
two principles in the universe, viz. spirit and matter.
Its doctrines being opposed to the oneness of the Vedas
led to the formation of another school called the Vedānta or Uttara-Mīmānasā system, asserting the opposite
idea of unity <s_dropdown>ekatvaṃ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>advaitaṃ,</s_dropdown> and shewing that the end or
aim of the Vedas was to inculcate the oneness of Spirit or
God) <s_dropdown>sāṃkhyaḥ, sāṃkhyadarśanaṃ;</s_dropdown> ‘with the commentary,’ <s_dropdown>sāṃkhyakārikā</s_dropdown>.
