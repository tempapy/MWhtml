‘Because’ may be often expressed by the abl. or inst. c.
of the abstract noun; as, ‘because it had no deepness
of earth,’ <s_dropdown>mṛdalpatvāt;</s_dropdown> ‘because he was a just man,’ <s_dropdown>sajjanatvāt;</s_dropdown> ‘because he was a friend,’ <s_dropdown>mitratayā</s_dropdown>. It may even
be expressed by <s_dropdown>iti;</s_dropdown> thus, ‘I am come, because a servant ought to be present at the fitting occasion,’ <s_dropdown>anujīvinā prāptakāle sānnidhyaṃ karttavyam iti āgato'smi</s_dropdown>.
