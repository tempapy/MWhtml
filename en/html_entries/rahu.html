of Singhikā, with the tail of a dragon. His head was
cut off by Vishnu, at the churning of the ocean; but
being immortal, by having tasted the amrit, the head
and tail retained their separate existence, and were
transferred to the stellar sphere. The head, or Rāhu,
became the cause of eclipses, by endeavouring at various

times to swallow the sun and moon. The tail was
called Ketu, or the descending node, <ab>see</ab> PLANET) <s_dropdown>rāhuḥ,</s_dropdown>
