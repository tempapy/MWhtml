BALARĀMA¦. This god is not often regarded as an avatār of
Vishnu, but rather as an incarnation of the great serpent Ananta; hence he is sometimes called <s_dropdown>śeṣaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>anantaḥ</s_dropdown>.
He was the son of Vasudeva by Devakī, but was transferred from the latter to the womb of Rohiṇī, the other
wife of Vasudeva, and hence his name, <s_dropdown>saṅkarṣaṇaḥ</s_dropdown>. Other

names for him are — (Fond of wine) <s_dropdown>priyamadhuḥ</s_dropdown> <ab>m.</ab> — (Killer
of the boxer Muṣṭika) <s_dropdown>muṣṭikāntakaḥ</s_dropdown>. — (Secret in motion)
<s_dropdown>guptacaraḥ</s_dropdown>. — (Strong and good) <s_dropdown>balabhadraḥ</s_dropdown>.
