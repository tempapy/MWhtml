                    <div id="definition"><ul>IN¦, <ab>prep.</ab> <s_dropdown>ni</s_dropdown> prefixed to roots may give the sense of ‘in;’ as,
‘to enter in,’ <s_dropdown>niviś;</s_dropdown> ‘to dwell in,’ <s_dropdown>nivas</s_dropdown>. When ‘in’
is used for ‘within,’ or ‘in the midst,’ it may be expressed
by <s_dropdown>antar, antarā, antare, madhye</s_dropdown>. But the most frequent use
of ‘in’ is expressed in Sanskrit by the locative case,
without any preposition; as, ‘in the city,’ <s_dropdown>nagare;</s_dropdown> ‘in the
night,’ <s_dropdown>rātrau;</s_dropdown> ‘a tree planted in the earth,’ <s_dropdown>pṛthivyāṃ ropito</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>vṛkṣaḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘confidence in you,’ <s_dropdown>tvayi viśvāsaḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘engaging in the
acquisition of wealth,’ <s_dropdown>arthārjane pravṛttiḥ</s_dropdown> <ab>f.;</ab> ‘the sun in the
east,’ <s_dropdown>prāci sūryyaḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘he sinks in the mud,’ <s_dropdown>paṅke majjati;</s_dropdown> ‘he
delights in the good of others,’ <s_dropdown>parahite ramate;</s_dropdown> ‘in the front
of the fight,’ <s_dropdown>raṇamūrddhi</s_dropdown>. In cases where ‘in’ refers to any
division of time, or the manner in which any thing is
done, it is usually expressed in Sanskrit by the instr.
case; as, ‘in three years,’ <s_dropdown>tribhir varṣaiḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘in twelve months,’
<s_dropdown>dvādaśabhir māsaiḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘in hundreds of years,’ <s_dropdown>varṣaśataiḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘in an
instant,’ <s_dropdown>kṣaṇena;</s_dropdown> ‘in process of time,’ <s_dropdown>kālaparyyāyeṇa;</s_dropdown> ‘in
how long time?’ <s_dropdown>kiyatā kālena;</s_dropdown> ‘in a short time,’ <s_dropdown>acireṇa;</s_dropdown>
‘in this manner,’ <s_dropdown>anena prakāreṇa;</s_dropdown> ‘in abundance,’ <s_dropdown>bāhulyena;</s_dropdown>
‘in the form of a man,’ <s_dropdown>nararūpeṇa;</s_dropdown> ‘in joke,’ <s_dropdown>parihāsena;</s_dropdown>
‘written in Sanskrit,’ <s_dropdown>saṃskṛtena racitaṃ</s_dropdown>. Certain adverbial
affixes and prefixes may often express ‘in;’ as, ‘in front,’
<s_dropdown>agratas;</s_dropdown> ‘in the first place,’ <s_dropdown>prathamatas;</s_dropdown> ‘in another place,’
<s_dropdown>anyatra;</s_dropdown> ‘in one place,’ <s_dropdown>ekatra;</s_dropdown> ‘in many places,’ <s_dropdown>bahutra;</s_dropdown> ‘in
the next world,’ <s_dropdown>amutra;</s_dropdown> ‘in every way,’ <s_dropdown>sarvvathā;</s_dropdown> ‘in another way,’ <s_dropdown>anyathā;</s_dropdown> ‘in one way,’ <s_dropdown>ekadhā;</s_dropdown> ‘in a hundred
ways,’ <s_dropdown>śatadhā;</s_dropdown> ‘in many ways,’ <s_dropdown>bahudhā;</s_dropdown> ‘in some way,’

<s_dropdown>kathañcit, kathañcana;</s_dropdown> ‘in small quantities,’ <s_dropdown>alpaśas;</s_dropdown> ‘in large
quantities,’ <s_dropdown>bahuśas;</s_dropdown> ‘in proper order,’ <s_dropdown>kramaśas, kramatas,</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>anukramaṃ;</s_dropdown> ‘in every direction,’ <s_dropdown>pratideśaṃ;</s_dropdown> ‘in three directions,’ <s_dropdown>tredhā;</s_dropdown> ‘in like manner,’ <s_dropdown>tathaiva, tadvat;</s_dropdown> ‘in vain,’
<s_dropdown>vṛthā, mudhā</s_dropdown>. Sometimes ‘in’ may be expressed by a participle; as, ‘he has pleasure in calumniating others,’
<s_dropdown>anyān parivadan sa tupyati</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>parābhiśaṃsanaṃ kṛtvā tuṣṭo bhavati;</s_dropdown> ‘what
bravery is there in killing a sleeping man?’ <s_dropdown>kiṃ pauruṣaṃ hatvā</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>suptaṃ;</s_dropdown> ‘he said that to me in joke,’ <s_dropdown>upahasya mām tad avadat</s_dropdown>.
The sense of ‘in,’ may be inherent in a noun; as, ‘to
go in and out,’ <s_dropdown>gamanāgamane kṛ</s_dropdown>. ‘In as much as,’ is expressed by <s_dropdown>yasmāt, yena,</s_dropdown> or by the abl. or instr. case of the
abstract noun; as, ‘in as much as it is founded on
observation,’ <s_dropdown>pratyakṣamūlatvāt</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>pratyakṣamūlatayā</s_dropdown>.
