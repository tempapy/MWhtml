                    <div id="definition"><ul>VISHNU¦, <ab>s.</ab> <s_dropdown>viṣṇuḥ</s_dropdown>. The second person of the Hindū triad,
and the most celebrated and popular of all the Indian
deities. He is the personification of the preserving
power, and became incarnate in nine different forms, for
the preservation of mankind in various emergencies.
Before the creation of the universe, and after its temporary annihilation, he is supposed to sleep on the
waters, floating on the serpent Śeṣa, and is then identified with Nārāyana. Brahmā, the creator, is fabled to
spring at that time from a lotus which grows from his
navel, whilst thus asleep. Viṣṇu's wife is called Lakṣmī, and the vehicle on which he rides, Garuḍa. <ab>See</ab>
LAKSHMI, GARUḌA. His ten avatārs or incarnations are:
1. The Matsya, or Fish. In this avatār Viṣṇu descended
in the form of a fish to save the pious king Satyavrata,
who with the seven Ṛiṣis and their wives had taken
refuge in the ark to escape the deluge which then
destroyed the earth. 2. The Kūrma, or Tortoise. In
this he descended in the form of a tortoise, for the purpose of restoring to man some of the comforts lost during the flood. To this end he stationed himself at the
bottom of the ocean, and allowed the point of the great
mountain Mandara to be placed upon his back, which
served as a hard axis, whereon the gods and demons,

with the serpent Vāsuki twisted round the mountain for
a rope, churned the waters for the recovery of the
amṛta or nectar, and fourteen other sacred things, <ab>see</ab>
OCEAN. 3. The Varāha, or Boar. In this he descended
in the form of a boar to rescue the earth from the
power of a demon called ‘golden-eyed,’ Hiraṇyākṣa.
This demon had seized on the earth and carried it with
him into the depths of the ocean. Viṣṇu dived into
the abyss, and, after a contest of a thousand years, slew
the monster. 4. The Narasinha, or Man-lion. In this
monstrous shape of a creature half-man, half-lion, Viṣṇu
delivered the earth from the tyranny of an insolent
demon called Hiraṇyakaśipu. 5. Vāmana, or Dwarf.
This avatār happened in the second age of the Hindūs or
Tretā yug, the four preceding are said to have occurred
in the first or Satya yug; the object of this avatar
was to trick Bali out of the dominion of the three worlds.
Assuming the form of a wretched dwarf he appeared
before the king, and asked, as a boon, as much land as
he could pace in three steps. This was granted; and
Viṣṇu, immediately expanding himself till he filled the
world, deprived Bali at two steps of heaven and earth,
but in consideration of some merit, left Pātāla still in his
dominion. 6. Paraśurāma. 7. Rāmachandra; for an
account of both these, <ab>see</ab> RĀMA. 8. Kṛṣna, or, according to some, Balarama, <ab>see</ab> KṚISHNA, RĀMA. 9. Buddha.
In this avatār Viṣṇu descended in the form of a sage,
for the purpose of making some reform in the religion
of the Brahmins, and especially to reclaim them from
their proneness to animal sacrifice. Many of the
Hindūs will not allow this to have been an incarnation
of their favourite god. 10. Kalki, or White Horse.
This is yet to come. Viṣṇu, mounted on a white
horse, with a drawn scimitar, blazing like a comet, will,
according to prophecy, end this present age, viz. the
fourth or Kali yug, by destroying the world, and then
renovating creation by an era of purity. Many of the
