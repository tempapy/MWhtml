                    <div id="definition"><ul>SACRAMENT¦, <ab>s.</ab> <s_dropdown>saṃskāraḥ, mahāyajñaḥ</s_dropdown>. For the twelve sanskāras or
sacred symbolical rites, <ab>see</ab> RITE. The following are the
five mahā-yajnas, or great sacraments of the Hindūs (as
explained in Manu III. 70. <ab>et. seq.</ab>), appointed to be performed every day by the Grihastha, or house-keeper, for
the sake of expiating the sin incurred by the involuntary
destruction of minute living creatures. They refer respectively to what is due to five objects, viz. himself,
the gods, his fore-fathers, spirits or ghosts, and men or
guests. 1. Study of Scripture, with prayer and meditation, called <s_dropdown>brahmayajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>ahutaḥ</s_dropdown>. 2. Offering oblations to
the gods in fire, called <s_dropdown>devayajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>hutaḥ</s_dropdown>. 3. Offering libations
of water and cakes to the manes of deceased ancestors,
called <s_dropdown>pitṛyajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>prāśitaṃ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>śrāddhaṃ</s_dropdown>. 4. Casting the residue
of oblations on the ground or in water, as an offering
to spirits or goblins, called <s_dropdown>bhūtayajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>baliyajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>prahutaḥ</s_dropdown> or
<s_dropdown>āhutaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>baliḥ</s_dropdown> <ab>m.</ab> 5. Receiving guests, and especially
Brahmans, with hospitality, called <s_dropdown>nṛyajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>manuppayajñaḥ</s_dropdown> or
<s_dropdown>brāhmyahutaṃ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>brāhmyaṃ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>brahmahutaṃ</s_dropdown>. The Viṣnu-Purāna adds two
other sacraments, viz. ‘propagation of offspring,’ <s_dropdown>prajāpatiyajñaḥ,</s_dropdown>
and ‘observance of truth,’ <s_dropdown>satyayajñaḥ,</s_dropdown> but these are comparatively modern additions. The Christian idea of a sacrament may be expressed by <s_dropdown>saṃskāraḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>khrīṣṭaprakalpitasaṃskāraḥ;</s_dropdown>
as, ‘the sacrament of baptism,’ <s_dropdown>jalasaṃskāraḥ</s_dropdown> or <s_dropdown>jalasecanasaṃskāraḥ</s_dropdown>
or <s_dropdown>majjanasaṃskāraḥ;</s_dropdown> ‘of the Lord's Supper,’ <s_dropdown>khrīṣṭabhojanasaṃskāraḥ</s_dropdown>
or <s_dropdown>khrīṣṭamṛnyuramaraṇārthakasaṃskāraḥ</s_dropdown>.
