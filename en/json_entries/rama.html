                    <div id="definition"><ul>RĀMA¦, <ab>s.</ab> The name common to three incarnations of Vishnu,
viz. 1. Paraśu Rāma, or Rāma with the axe, the sixth
avatār or incarnation of Vishnu. He was a Brahman,
the son of the holy sage Jamadagni, and born at the beginning of the second or Treta age, for the purpose of
repressing the tyranny, and punishing the violence of
the Kshatriya or military tribe. He appears to typefy
the class of Brahmans, and their contest with the Kshatriyas. Some of his names are <s_dropdown>paraśurāmaḥ -makaḥ, paraśudharaḥ, parśurāmaḥ,</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>jamadagnisutaḥ, jāmadagnyaḥ</s_dropdown>. 2. Rāmachandra or the moon-like
Rāma, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. He was
born into the world as the son of Daśaratha, king of
Oude, and great grandson of Raghu, at the close of the
second or Treta age, for the purpose of destroying the
demons who infested the earth, and especially Rāvana, the
Daitya sovereign of Ceylon. His names are <s_dropdown>rāmacandraḥ,</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>raghunandanaḥ, raghūdvahaḥ, raghuvaraḥ, raghunāthaḥ, rāghavaḥ, rāvaṇāriḥ</s_dropdown> <ab>m.,</ab> <s_dropdown>rāvaṇajit</s_dropdown> <ab>m.,</ab> <s_dropdown>daśāsyajit</s_dropdown> <ab>m.,</ab> <s_dropdown>makhatrātā</s_dropdown> <ab>m.</ab> <s_dropdown>(tṛ), rāmabhadraḥ</s_dropdown>. 3. Balarāma,
or the strong Rāma, according to some the eighth incarnation of Vishnu. He was born at the end of the Dvāpara, or third age, as the seventh son of Vasudeva and
Devakī, and therefore elder brother of Krishna, but was
transferred from the womb of Devakī to that of Rohinī
the other wife of Vasudeva. Hence one of his names
<s_dropdown>saṅkarṣaṇaḥ</s_dropdown>. He is sometimes regarded as an incarnation
of the serpent Ananta or Śeṣa, and hence called, <s_dropdown>anantaḥ,</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>śeṣaḥ</s_dropdown>. His other names are <s_dropdown>balarāmaḥ, baladevaḥ, balabhadraḥ, balaḥ,</s_dropdown>
<s_dropdown>balalaḥ, halāyudhaḥ, halabhṛt</s_dropdown> <ab>m.,</ab> <s_dropdown>halī</s_dropdown> <ab>m.</ab> <s_dropdown>(n), sīrapāṇiḥ</s_dropdown> <ab>m.,</ab> <s_dropdown>kṛṣṇāgrajaḥ, acyutāgrajaḥ, priyamadhuḥ</s_dropdown> <ab>m.,</ab> <s_dropdown>madhupriyaḥ, muṣṭikāntakaḥ, gupnacaraḥ, revatī-</s_dropdown>
