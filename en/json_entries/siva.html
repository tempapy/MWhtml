                    <div id="definition"><ul>ŚIVA¦, <ab>s.</ab> A celebrated Hindū God, the Destroyer of Creation,
and therefore the most formidable of the Hindū Triad.
He also personifies reproduction, since the Hindū philosophy excludes the idea of total annihilation without
subsequent regeneration. Hence he is sometimes confounded with Brahmā, the Creator, or first person of the
Triad. He is the particular god of the Tāntṛkas, or
followers of the books called Tantras. His worshippers
are termed Śaivas, and although not so numerous as
the Vaishnavas, exalt their god to the highest place in
the heavens, and combine in him many of the attributes
which properly belong to the other deities. According
to them Śiva is Time, Justice, Fire, Water, the Sun, the
Destroyer and Creator. As presiding over generation,
his type is the Linga, or Phallus, the origin probably of
the Phallic emblem of Egypt and Greece. As the god
of generation and of justice, which latter character he
shares with the god Yama, he is represented riding
a white bull. His own colour, as well as that of the
bull, is generally white, referring probably to the unsullied purity of Justice. His throat is dark blue; his
hair of a light reddish colour, and thickly matted together,
and gathered above his head like the hair of an ascetic.
He is sometimes seen with two hands, sometimes with
four, eight, or ten, and with five faces. He has three
eyes, one being in the centre of his forehead, pointing
up and down. These are said to denote his view of the

three divisions of time, past, present, and future. He
holds a trident in his hand to denote, as some say, his
relationship to water, or according to others, to show
that the three great attributes of Creator, Destroyer,
and Regenerator are combined in him. His loins are
enveloped in a tiger's skin. In his character of Time,
he not only presides over its extinction, but also its astronomical regulation. A crescent or half-moon on his
forehead indicates the measure of time by the phases
of the moon; a serpent forms one of his necklaces to
denote the measure of time by years, and a second necklace of human skulls marks the lapse and revolution of
ages, and the extinction and succession of the generations
of mankind. He is often represented as entirely
covered with serpents, which are the emblems of immortality. They are bound in his hair, round his neck,
wrists, waist, arms, and legs; they serve as rings for
his fingers, and earrings for his ears, and are his constant companions. Śiva has more than a thousand
names, which are detailed at length in the sixty-ninth
chapter of the Śiva Purāna. The following list of the
principal of these will give the best idea of his character
